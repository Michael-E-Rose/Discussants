Expectations Hypotheses Tests,AP,2000,
Labor Income and Predictable Stock Returns,AP,2000,"We propose and test a novel economic mechanism that generates time varying expected returns. In our model, investors' income has two sources, wages and dividens, that grow stochastically over time. As a consequence, the fraction of total income produced by wages changes over time depending on economic conditions. We show that as this fraction fluctuates, the risk premium that investors require to hold stocks varies as well. Tests of the main implications of the model are strongly confirmed in the data. A regression of stock returns on lagged values of the labor income to consumption ration produces statistically significant coefficients and adjusted R-squared's that are larger than those generated when using the dividend price ratio. We also derive and test the model's implications for the cross section. We find considerable improvements on the performance of both the conditional CAPM and CCAPM when compared to their unconditional counterparts."
Momentum Profits and the Autocorrelation of Returns,AP,2000,"This paper investigates the autocorrelation patterns in stock returns to better understand the source of momentum profits. The autocorrelations provide no evidence that investors underreact to new information. Over intermediate horizons of one to 18 months, higher past returns for stock portfolios are almost always associated with lower future returns during the period 1941 – 1997. Cross-serial correlations among stocks are also negative and, using the framework of Lo and MacKinlay (1990), appear to explain the profitability of momentum strategies. The evidence suggests that stocks covary ‘too strongly’ with each other, so that momentum profits and excess volatility in aggregate returns represent the same phenomenon."
Risks for the Long Run: A Resolution of Asset Pricing Puzzles,AP,2000,"In this paper we model dividend and consumption growth rates as having a small long-run predictable component. Such a component, for which we provide empirical support, plays a very signi cant role in determining asset prices. We show that, in equilibrium, these growth rate dynamics in conjunction with 'plausible' parameter con gurations of the Epstein and Zin (1989) preferences can explain key observed asset markets phenomena. In particular, the model is capable of justifying the observed equity premium, the low risk free rate, and the volatilities of the market return and the real risk free rate."
Spurious Regressions in Financial Economics?,AP,2000,"We study biases associated with regression models in which persistent lagged variables predict stock returns, either linearly or in interaction with contemporaneous values of a market index return. We focus on the issue of spurious regression, related to the classic studies of Yule (1926) and Granger and Newbold (1974). We find that spurious regression is a concern in regressions of stock returns on persistent lagged instruments, especially when the predictable component of returns is large. In regressions where the lagged instruments interact with a market index return, the spurious regression problem is not as severe. Without persistent time-variation in the expected market return and beta, spurious regression bias is not an important issue. However, when a common persistent factor drives expected market returns and betas, spurious regression becomes a concern. Large sample sizes are no defense against the spurious regression bias."

Does Distance Still Matter? The Information Revolution In Small Business Lending?,CF,2000,"The distance between small firms and their lenders in the United States is increasing. Not only are firms choosing more distant lenders, they are also communicating with them in more impersonal ways. After documenting these systematic changes, we demonstrate that they do not stem from small firms locating differently, from consolidation in the banking industry, or from biases in the sample. Instead, they seem correlated with improvements in bank productivity. We conjecture that greater, and more timely, availability of borrower credit records, as well as the greater ease of processing these may explain the greater amount of lending at a distance. Consistent with such an explanation, unlike in the past, distant firms no longer have to be observably the highest quality credits, suggesting that a wider cross-section of firms can now obtain funding from a particular lender. These findings, we believe, are direct evidence that there has been substantial development of the financial sector in the past few years in the United States, even in areas such as small business lending that have not been directly influenced by the growth in public markets. From a policy perspective, that small firms now obtain wider access to financing suggests the consolidation of banking services may not raise as strong anti-trust concerns as in the past."

Roll-ups: Performance and Incentives for Industry-Consolidating IPOs,CF,2000,"This study examines the motivations for and empirical performance of roll-up transactions, a special class of initial public equity offering where multiple small business entities are consolidated into a single publicly traded company. Using a sample of 47 deals initiated between 1994 and 1998, we find that the long-term stock price performance of profitability for these new firms are, on average, significantly lower than those for companies from comparable industries. An analysis of the cross-sectional variation in long-run stock performance reveals that it is important that managers and owners of companies acquired in the roll-up remain involved in the business as shareholders and dierctiors. Further, while the market's response to announcements of subsequent acquisitions by the roll-up firms is positive, market-adjusted post-announcements returns are significantly negative. We conclude that, as an organizational form, roll-ups have not met investor expectations and have, on average, decreased shareholder value."
Stock Options for Undiversified Executives*,CF,2000,"We develop a certainty-equivalence framework to analyze the cost and value of, and incentives provided by, non-tradable options held by undiversified risk-averse executives. We derive “Executive Value” lines, the risk-adjusted analogues to Black-Scholes lines, and distinguish between “executive value” and “company cost.” We show that this framework explains (or sheds light on) virtually all of the major stylized facts about stock option practices, including: 1. Why executives often argue that Black-Scholes values are too high, 2. Why executives typically demand large premiums to exchange options for cash (suggesting that options are an expensive way to convey pay),  3. Why executive reported pay levels have increased substantially over the past decade (while risk-adjusted increases have been far more modest), 4. Why virtually all options are granted at-the-money, 5. Why “indexed options” and “premium options” are rarely observed in practice despite their strong advocates and seemingly attractive features, 6. Why companies often re-set the exercise price on underwater options, 7. Why executives often exercise stock options well before expiration (even for non-dividend paying stocks), forfeiting substantial option value, 8. Why companies allow executives to exercise options prior to expiration (and why this policy is advantageous to both executives and shareholders), 9. Why short vesting periods (which have modest effects on executive value and company cost) are the norm (and why long vesting periods are almost never observed in practice)."
The Really Long Run Performance of IPOs- the Pre-NASDAQ Evidence,CF,2000,"Financial economists in recent years have closely examined and intensely debated the performance of initial public offerings using data after the formation of NASDAQ. The paper seeks to shed light on this controversy by undertaking a large, out-of-sample study: we examine the performance for five years after listing of nearly 3,700 initial public offerings in the United States from 1935 to 1972. The sample shows subtantial underperformance when event time buy-and-hold abnormal returns are used. The underperformance disappears, however, when cumulative abnormal returns are utilized. A calendar time analysis also shows that over the entire sample period - i.e., from 1935 to 1976 - IPOs return as much as the market. But periods directly after heavy IPO volumes are associated with low IPO and benchmark returns, suggesting that managers at IPO firms may target peaks in overall market valuation. Finally, the intercepts in CAPM and Fama-French three-factor regressions are insignificantly different from zero, suggesting no abnormal performance."
Venture Capital and the Professionalization of Start-up Firms: Empirical Evidence,CF,2000,"This paper examines empirical evidence on the impact that venture capitalists can have on the development path of new firms. We use a hand-collected data set on Silicon Valley start-up companies that allows us to “look inside the black box” and analyze the influence of venture capital on the professionalization of firms’ internal organization. The evidence suggests that there is a “soft” facet to venture capitalists, in terms of supporting companies to build up their human resources within the organization. Venture capital is also important at the top, in that venture capital backed companies are more likely and faster to bring in outsiders as CEOs. These CEO replacements are often accompanied with the founder departing from the company, suggesting that venture capitalists also  exhibit a “hard” facet in terms of exercising control. The paper examines how these various roles are interrelated, and shows how the role of venture capital varies with the state of the company."
A Game Theoretic View of the Fiscal Theory of the Price Level,EFCE,2000,"The goal of this paper is to probe the validity of the scal theory of the price level by modeling explicitly the market structure in which households and the governments make their decisions. I describe the economy as a game, and I am thus able to state precisely the consequences of actions that are out of the equilibrium path. I show that there exist government strategies that lead to a version of the scal theory, in which the price level is determined by scal variables alone. However, these strategies are more complex than the simple budgetary rules usually associated with the scal theory, and the government budget constraint cannot be merely viewed as an equilibrium condition."
A Monetary Shock in an Uncertain and Sequential Trade Model,EFCE,2000,"I study the effects of a monetary shock in a simple version of the uncertain and sequential trade (UST) model. A negative money shock has: (a) no effect on quoted prices in the first period, (b) a negative effect on output, (c) a positive effect on the interest rate, (d) a negative effect on the real wages and (e) a negative effect on real profits. These effects are in accordance with the stylized facts in Christiano Eichenbaum and Evans (1997)."
An Econometric Model of the Yield Curve with Macroeconomic Jump Effects,EFCE,2000,"This paper develops an arbitrage-free time-series model of yields that incorporates central bank policy. The model introduces a class of linear-quadratic jump diffusions as state variables. A special case of this setup is used to describe U.S. interest rates, the Federal Reserve’s target rate, and key macroeconomic aggregates. The U.S. application captures: (i) target-rate moves on FOMC meeting days, (ii) ‘exceptional’ policy moves outside of FOMC meetings, and (iii) releases of macroeconomic news that are likely to affect future Fed actions. To fit the model, the method of simulated-maximum-likelihood estimation is extended to allow for jump-diffusions. Introducing the target rate as a fourth, observable, factor into a three-latent-factor framework is shown to be a tractable way of improving the overall term-structure fit, especially at short maturities. A policy-inertia factor influences the conditional probability of target changes. Fed policy is linked to the increased volatility of yields on FOMC meeting and release days, and to the the observed “snake-shaped” term structure of yield volatility."

Evaluating the Costs of Business Cycles in Models of Endogenous Growth,EFCE,2000,"In his famous monograph, Lucas (1987) put forth an argument that the welfare gains from reducing the volatility of aggregate consumption are negligible. Subsequent work that has revisited Lucas’ calculation has continued to find only small benefits from reducing the volatility ofconsumption, further reinforcing the perception that business cycles don’t matter. This paper argues instead that fluctuations could affect the growth process, which could have much larger effects than consumption volatility. I present an argument for why stabilization could increase growth without a reduction in current consumption, which could imply substantial welfare effects as Lucas (1987) already observed in his calculation. Empirical evidence and calibration exercises suggest that the welfare effects can be quite substantial, possibly as much as two orders of magnitude greater than Lucas’ original estimates."

Optimal Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Volatility in a Small Open Economy,EFCE,2000,"We lay out a tractably small open economy version of the canonical sticky price model, and use it as a framework to study the properties of three alternative monetary regimes: (a) optimal monetary policy, (b) a Taylor rule, and (c) an exchange rate peg. Several interesting results emerge from our analysis. First, the optimal policy is shown to entail a positive correlation between domestic and world interest rates. That doesn't prevent sizable fluctuations of nominal and real exchange rates from occurring, though the implied volatility of those variables is much smaller than the empirical one. Second, a Taylor rule generally leads to excess volatility of nominal variables, and excess smoothness of real variables, relative to the optimal policy. Finally, we show that a pure exchange rate peg seems to have better stabilization properties than a Taylor rule."
Re-Examining the Contributions of Money and Banking Shocks to the U.S. Great Depression,EFCE,2000,"This paper quantitavely evaluates the hypothesis that deflation can account for much of the Great Depression (1929-33). We examine two popular explanations of the Depression: (1) The ""high wage"" story, according to which deflation, combined with imperfectly flexible wages, raised real wages and reduced employment and output. (2) The ""bank failure"" story, accodring to which deflationary money shocks contributed to bank failures and to a reduction in the efficiency of financial intermediation, which in turn reduced lending and output. We evaluate these stories using general equilibrium business cycle models, and find that wage shocks and banking shocks account for a small fraction of the Great Depression. We also find that some other predictions of the theories are at variance with the data."

Asymptotics for Out of Sample Tests of Causality Tests of Equal Forecast Accuracy and Encompassing for Nested Models,EFWW,2000,"This paper presents analytical and numerical evidence concerning out of sample tests of causality. The relevant environment is one in which the relative predictive ability of two nested parametric regression models is of interest. Results are provided for three statistics: a regression-based statistic suggested by Granger and Newbold (1977), a t-type statistic comparable to those suggested by Diebold and Mariano (1995) and West (1996), and an F-type statistic akin to Theil's U (1966). Since the limiting distributions under the null are nonstandard, tables of asymptotically valid critical values are provided. The null limiting distributions indicate that overfit models should predict poorly and that the Principle of Parsimony should be applied judiciously. Power calculations under a local alternative provide some guidance on the choice of test statistic and the percentage of the sample withheld for predictive evaluation."

Estimating Stochastic Volatility Diffusions Using Conditional Moments of Integrated Volatility,EFWW,2000,"We exploit the distributional information contained in high-frequency intraday data in constructing a simple conditional moment estimator for stochastic volatility diffusions. The estimator is based on the analytical solutions of the first two conditional moments for the integrated volatility, which is e ectively approximated by the quadratic variation of the process. We successfully implement the resulting GMM estimator with high-frequency five-minute foreign exchange and equity index returns. Our simulation evidence and actual empirical results indicate that the method is very reliable and accurate. The computational speed of the procedure compares very favorably to other existing estimation methods in the literature."
Nonlinear Features of Realized FX Volatility,EFWW,2000,
Nonparametric Estimation of Single Factor Heath-Jarrow-Morton Term Structure Models and a Test for Path Independence,EFWW,2000,"A nonparametric estimator of the term structure's volatility is provided for a class of Heath-Jarrow Morton term structure models. This class of models is important because it captures, as a special case, all term structure models where the short term interest rate follows a time-homogenous univariate Markov diffusion in the equivalent risk neutral economy; such a structure is frequently considered in the term structure literature. A test for this 'Markovian short-term interest rate based structure' is developed. We find that this Markovian short-term interest rate based structure is not rejected. The result suggests that a sufficiently flexible one factor Markov short-term interest rate based model is able to capture the dynamics of the empirical terms structure of interest rates in the US bond market. A caveat of course is that nonparametric procedures inherently require large sample sizes."

This dramatic shift is used as an experiment to explore whether its cause could be related to data snooping, or deeper economic issues."

There are no plausible, common-knowledge alternatives, regardless of intervention type (e.g announced vs. unannounced), and regardless of efficacy channel (e.g., portfolio vs information). This paper recasts intervention analysis into a framework of asymmetric information. This allows us to address long-standing questions in a new way. We offer four main results. First, we find evidence of imperfect substitutability, a necessary condition for the efficacy of the portfolio channel. Second, we find evidence of an operative signaling channel. Third, we establish a lower bound on the unconditional price impact of sterilized trades: 5 basis points per $100 million. Fourth, we provide an explicit answer to an important unanswered question: “When should Central Banks intervene?”"

Explaining Why So Many Households Do Not Save,ME,2000,"There are vast differences in wealth holdings, even among households in similar age groups. In addition, a large percentage of U.S. households arrive close to retirement with little or no wealth. While many explanations can be found to rationalize these facts,  approximately thirty percent of households whose head is close to retirement have done little or no planning for retirement. Planning is shaped by the experience of other individuals: individuals learn to plan for retirement from older siblings. They also learn from the experience of old parents. In  particular, unpleasant events, such as financial difficulties and health shocks at the end of life, provide incentives toward planning. In addition, planning affects wealth levels as well as portfolio choice. Individuals who plan are more likely to hold large amounts of wealth and to invest their wealth holdings in high return assets, such as stocks. Thus, planning plays an important role in explaining the saving behavior of many households."

A Real Options Approach to Housing Investment,PERE,2000,"In this paper, we focus on investments by existing homeowners to improve their homes. In our model, the value of a house is equal to the expected net present value of a perpetual stream of service flows emanating from the attributes of the house. An important innovation in our model is that the set of house attributes evolves over time according to the investment decisions of the homeowner. The homeowner’s decisions to invest in house attributes are modeled as real options. The homeowner compares the value of an additional attribute, net of the value of the opportunity to invest in the future, to the cost of the investment when deciding whether or not to invest. Our model of investment embeds a multi–factor term structure model and a general model of the evolution of service flows. We employ numeric simulations to explore the properties of the investment model, and to motivate our empirical test of the model. The main contribution of this paper is an empirical test of whether or not observed homeowner investment behavior is consistent with the real option theory of investment. Using a nationally representative panel from the American Housing Survey, we test two implications of the real option theory. First, we test whether investment is more likely when the spread between the return to housing and the cost of capital is wide. Second, we test whether greater spread volatility depresses investment. Our empirical results indicate that observed homeowner investment behavior is consistent with these implications of the theory, even after controlling for business cycle, aging, tenure and for–sale influences."
Confronting Information Asymmetries: Evidence from Real Estate Markets,PERE,2000,"This paper studies the role of asymmetric information in commercial real estate markets in the U.S. and Canada. We propose a novel and exogenous measure of information based on the quality of property tax assessments in different regions and time periods. Employing direct and indirect information variables, we find strong evidence that information considerations are significant in this market. We show that market participants resolve information asymmetries by purchasing nearby properties, trading properties with long income histories, and avoiding transactions with informed professional brokers. The evidence that the choice of financing is used to address information concerns is mixed and weak."

Intergenerational Fiscal Constitutions: How to Protect Future Generations Using Land Taxes and Federalism,AMRE,2001,"This paper studies how to design a fiscal constitution that, by capitalizing intergenerational spillovers into land values, is able to protect future generations from expropriation and to generate optimal investment in intergenerational public goods. In particular, we study how to accomplish these goals by changing two dimensions of the fiscal constitution: (1) the level of government to which different types of intergenerational public goods are assigned, and (2) the tax base of the different jurisdictions. We show that the instruments required to generate capitalization of the intergenerational spillovers depend on the type of the spillover. Land taxation is the essential instrument for policies that mostly generate fiscal spillovers, such as debt and public infrastructure. By contrast, interjurisdictional competition is the essential instrument for policies that mostly generate direct spillovers, such as irreversible environmental damages. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to design a fiscal constitution that generates full capitalization of fiscal spillovers, but in general, not one that generates full capitalization of direct spillovers."

"Stock Market Wealth, Housing Market Wealth, Spending and Consumption",AMRE,2001,"We examine the link between increases in housing wealth, financial wealth and consumer spending. We rely upon a panel of 13 countries observed annually for various periods during past 25 years and a panel of U.S. states oberved quarterly during the 1980s and 1990s. We impute the aggregate value of owner-occupied housing, the value of financial assets, and measures of aggregate consumption for each of the geographic units over time. We estimate regressions relating to consumption to income and wealth measures, finding a statistically significant and rather large effect of housing wealth upon household consumption."
A Century of Stock Market Liquidity and Trading Costs,AP,2001,"I assemble an annual time series of bid-ask spreads on Dow Jones stocks from 1898-1998, along with an annual estimate of the weighted-average commission rate for trading NYSE stocks since  1925. Spreads gradually declined over the course of the century but are punctuated by sharp rises during periods of market turmoil. Proportional one-way commissions rise dramatically to a peak of nearly 1% in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, and fall sharply following commission deregulation in 1975. The sum of half-spreads and one-way commissions, multiplied by annual turnover, is an estimate of the annual proportional cost of aggregate equity trading. This cost drives a wedge between aggregate gross equity returns and net equity returns. This wedge can account for only a small part of the observed equity premium, but all else equal the gross equity premium is perhaps 1% lower today than it was early in the 1900’s. Finally, I present evidence that these measures of liquidity – spreads and turnover – predict stock returns up to one year ahead. High spreads predict high stock returns; high turnover predicts low stock returns. This suggests that liquidity is an important determinant of conditional expected returns."

Inflation and Earnings Uncertainty and the Volatility of Asset Prices: An Empirical Investigation,AP,2001,"We formulate and test the relationship between stock and bonds volatilities and covariances and market participants' uncertainty about future inflation and earnings. Uncertainty is measured either using Survey data, as the dispersion of economists' point forecasts of future fundamentals, or, by fitting a model for inflation and earnings that allows for fluctuating uncertainty. The latter is highly correlated with Survey-based measures, and can be updated from traded asset prices frequently. Stock and short/medium-term bond return volatilities increase during periods of high inflation and earnings uncertainty, while the volatility of longer-term bonds does not. In addition, the covariance between stock and bonds returns is higher during periods of greater uncertainty, which we interpret it is due to the higher volatility of the stochastic discount factor in these periods. Finally, we find that the fundamental's unvertainty plays a more prominent role than the volatility fundamentals to explain both return volatilities and cross-covariances. The estimated model sheds light on the alternative channels through which inflation news affects asset returns and imporves volatility forecasts."

Why Does the Slope of the Term Structure Forecast Excess Returns?,AP,2001,"In the U.S., the slope of the term structure is positively correlated with expected future excess returns to both stocks and long-maturity bonds. This paper empirically investigates possible explanations for this pattern. The results pose a significant challenge for representative agent, consumption-based asset-pricing models. I find that when the term structure is more steeply sloped than average, (1) future volatility of aggregate consumption growth is much lower than average; (2) future correlations between aggregate consumption growth and returns to both stocks and bonds are roughly zero; (3) the well-documented positive relation between excess stock and bond returns and subsequent growth in real variables (e.g., labor income and GDP) disappears. These facts are inconsistent with the hypothesis that a representative agent has standard power utility, recursive utility, or habit formation preferences."

Financial Conservatism: Evidence on Capital Structure from Low Leverage Firms,CF,2001,"A persistent and puzzling empirical regularity is the fact that many firms adopt conservative financial policies. These “under-leveraged” firms carry substantially less debt than predicted by dominant theories of capital structure (Graham (2000) and Myers (1984)). This paper examines the phenomenon of financial conservatism by studying firms that adopt a persistent policy of low leverage. Our major findings are as follows. 1) Conservative firms follow a pecking order style financial policy. A high flow of funds and substantial cash balances allow them to fund the bulk of discretionary expenditures internally. 2) Financial conservatism is largely transitory. Seventy percent of low leverage firms drop their conservative financial policy; almost 50% do so within five years. 3) Conservative firms stockpile financial slack or debt capacity. Their “stockpiles” are utilized later to finance discretionary expenditures, particularly acquisitions and capital expenditures.. 4) Financial conservatism is not an industry-based phenomenon. Conservative firms do, however, have relatively high market-to-book and operate relatively frequently in industries thought to be sensitive to financial distress. 5) Conservative firms do not have low tax rates, high non-debt tax shields or face severe information asymmetries."

The Tax (Dis-) Advantage of a Firm Issuing Options on its Own Stock,CF,2001,"It is common for firms to issue or purchase options on the firm’s own stock. This occurs when firms issue warrants, call options as employee compensation, convertible bonds, or sell put options as part of share repurchase programs. This paper shows that option positions with implicit borrowing—such as put sales and call purchases—are tax-disadvantaged relative to the equivalent synthetic option with explicit borrowing. Conversely, option positions with implicit lending—such as compensation calls—are tax-advantaged. We perform back-of-the-envelope calculations to get a sense of the importance of these effects. For example, the present value of the tax cost to Dell Computer from one put issue was likely in excess of $60m. We discuss possible reasons for firms to undertake such tax-disadvantaged transactions."

Liquidity Effects in the Bond Markets,EFCE,2001,"We analyze mergers over the past century in a growth model that emphasizes technological change. We explain the positive relation between mergers and stock prices, the positive relation between internal growth of firms and their acquisitions, and the positive relation of mergers with other measures of reallocation such as entry and exit. More broadly, mergers help us to reallocate assets more smoothly, thereby raising returns to investment and the growth rate. We also find that merger waves are shorter when technological change is more dramatic, when the capital of other firms is less costly to transfer, and when entry and exit are a smooth reallocation mechanism. This last result underscores that entry and exit on the one hand and mergers on the other are substitute means of reallocation."

These findings are broadly consistent with the predictions of the UST model but other findings about the timing of the maximal effects are not.

Consumers living near this border can shift their expenditures between the two countries, so real exchange rate fluctuations can act as demand shocks to border areas’ retail trade industries. Using county level data, we estimate the effects of real exchange rates on the number of establishments and their average payroll in five retail industries. To isolate the expenditure-shifting effect of exchange rates, our estimation uses observations from counties off the border to control for the economy-wide effects of the unobserved structural shocks. In three of the industries, the number of operating establishments responds either contemporaneously or with a lag of one year to real exchange rate movements."

Adverse Selection and the Accelerator,EFEL,2001,"I construct a dynamic model in which adverse selection in credit markets causes a financial accelerator. I answer three questions: Does the financial system stabilize or destabilize the economy; how large are these effects; and how can we empirically distinguish between amplifiers and stabilizers? I contrast my model with the costly state verification model. Unike the costly state verification mechanism, the adverse selection model has the potential to stabilize shocks rather than amplify them. I show that the adverse selection forces are much more powerful than the aplifier effects in the costly state verification framework. Although accelerators and stabilizers are observationally equivalent along many dimensions, I present a statistic that can distinguish between them"
Aggregate Consequences of Limited Contract Enforceability,EFEL,2001,"In this paper we develop a general equilibrium model in which entrepreneurs finance investment by signing long-term contracts with a financial intermediary. Because of enforceability problems, financial contracts are constrained efficient. After showing that the micro structure of the model captures some of the observed features of the investment policy and dynamics of firms, we show that limited enforceability makes the diffusion of new technologies sluggish and amplifies their impact on aggregate output."
Asset Pricing Implications of Financing Constraints,EFEL,2001,"We ask whether firms' financing constraints are quantitatively important in explaining stock returns. We show that, for a large class of theoretical models, firms' financing constraints have a parsimonious representation amenable to empirical analysis. Quantitative experiments suggest that financing constraints can help match the volatility of stock returns but at the cost of reducing the model's ability to match stocks' return correlation structure. This latter effect makes financing constraints unsuccessful in improving the overall statistical ability of investment returns as a factor pricing model."

Exhuming Q: Market Power vs. Capital Market Perfections,EFEL,2001,"Evidence of the statistical significance of profits in Q regressions remains one of the principal findings in the empirical investment literature. This result is frequently taken to support the view that capital market imperfections are an important element for understanding investment. This paper challenges that conclusion. We argue that allowing the profit function at the firm level to be strictly concave, reflecting, for example, market power, is sufficent to replicate the Q theory based regression results in which profits are a significant factor determining investment. To be clear, our ability to replicate the existing results does not require the specification of any capital market imperfections. Thus the friction that explains the statistical significance of profits could be market power by sellers rather than capital market imperfections."

The Credit Cycle and the Business Cycle: New Findings Using the Survey of Senior Loan Officers,EFEL,2001,"VAR analysis on a measure of commercial lending standards collected by the Federal Reserve reveals that shocks to lending standards have a significant impact on both commercial loan volume and real output. Fluctuations in standards matter even when we add additional controls for credit quality and demand, suggesting that standards shocks can be identified with reductions in the supply of bank credit. Higher loan levels cause lending standards to tighten, suggesting a credit cycle with stop-and-go dynamics: positive loan shocks drive standards up, positive standards shocks drive loans down . . . ad infinitum. Fluctuations in standards matter far more (for loans and output) than do commercial loan rates, consistent with the role of informational frictions, quantity rationing, and credit availability effects in the transmission of economic shocks. Yet contrary to the hypothesis of a narrow bank lending channel, innovations in the federal funds rate (“monetary policy shocks”) do not cause changes in credit standards; bankers simply adjust loan rates instead. Tightenings in credit standards, however, do cause easings in monetary policy. An examination of inventory behavior, the component of GDP most closely associated with bank business lending, indicates that lending standards are significant in structural inventory investment equations. The estimated impact of a moderate tightening of standards on inventory investment is of the same order of magnitude as the decline in inventory investment over the typical recession."

The Real Effects of Financial Development,EFEL,2001,"We construct a new indicator of financial development by estimating a regional effect on the probability that, ceteris paribus, a household is shut off from the credit market. By using this indicator we show that the level of local financial development enhances the probability an individual starts his own business, increases the creation of new firms and the level of competition, eases liquidity constraints, and promotes growth of firms. As predicted by theory, these effects are stronger for smaller firms than for larger ones, which can more easily raise funds outside of the local area. Overall, the results suggest local financial development is an important determinant of the economic success of an area."
Financial Liberalization and the Allocation of Investment: Micro Evidence from Developing Countries,EFEL; IFM,2001,"Has financial liberalization improved the efficiency with which investment funds are allocated to competing uses? In this paper, we address this question, using firm level panel data from twelve developing countries. The basic idea is to investigate whether financial liberalization has increased the share of investment going to firms with a higher marginal return to capital. To this end we develop a summary index of the efficiency of allocation of investment. We then examine the relationship between this index and various measures of financial liberalization. The results suggest that in the majority of cases financial reform has lead to an increase in the efficiency with which investment funds are allocated."

Bias Corrected Instrumental Variables Estimation for Dynamic Panel Models with Fixed Effects,EFWW,2001,This paper analyzes the second order bias of instrumental variables estimators for a dynamic panel model with fixed effects. Three different methods of second order bias correction are considered. Simulation experiments show that these methods perform well if the model does not have a root near unity but break down near the unit circle. To remedy the problem near the unit root a weak instrument approximation is used. We show that an estimator based on long differencing the model is approximately achieving the minimal bias in a certain class of instrumental variables (IV) estimators. Simulation experiments document the performance of the promosed procedure in finite samples.
Bootstrapping GMM Estimators for Time Series,EFWW,2001,"This paper establishes that the bootstrap provides asymptotic refinements for the generalized method of moments estimator of overidentfied linear models when autocovariance structures of moment functions are unknown. Because the heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent covariance matrix estimator cannot be written as a function of sample moments and converges at a rate slower than T ¡1=2 , the asymptotic refinement cannot be proved in the conventional way. As a result, we  find that the bootstrap approximation error for the distribution of the t test and the test of overidentifying restrictions is of larger order than typically found in the literature. We also find that the choice of kernels plays a more important role in our second-order asymptotic theory than in the conventional  first-order asymptotic theory. Nevertheless, the bootstrap approximation improves upon the  first-order asymptotic approximation. A Monte Carlo experiment shows that the bootstrap improves the accuracy of inference on regression parameters in small samples. We apply our bootstrap method to inference about the parameters in the monetary policy reaction function."
Detecting Lack of Identification in GMM,EFWW,2001,"In the stadnard linear instrumental variables regression model, it must be assumed that the instruments are correlated with endogenous variables in ortder to ensure the consistency and asymptotic normality of the usual instrumental variables estimator. Indeed, if the instruments are only slightly correlated with endogenous variables, the conventional Guassian asymptotic theory may still provide a very poor approximation to the finite sample distribution of the usual instrumental variables estimator. Because of the crucial roles of this identification condition, it is common to test for instrument relevance by a first-stage F-test. Identification issues also arise in the generalized method of moments model, of which the linear instrumental variables model is a special case. But I know of no means of testing for identification in this model, in the existing literature. This paper proposes a test of the null of underidentification in the generalized method of moments model."

Inference of Factor Models of Large Dimensions,EFWW,2001,"This paper develops the inferential theory for factor models of large dimensions. The principal component method is considered because it is easy to implement in practice and it is asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood method (if normality is assumed). We derive the rate of convergence and the limiting distributions of the estimated factors, factor loadings, and common components. The theory is developed under the framework of large cross section (N) and large time dimensions (T), a setting to which the classical factor analysis does not apply. We show that the estimated common components are asymptotically normal with a convergence rate equaly to the square root of the minimum of N and T. The estimated factors and their loadings are generally normal, although not always so. Conditions for non-normality are identified. The convergence rate of the estimated factors and factor loadings can be faster than that of the estimated common components. These results are obtained under general conditions that allow for correlations and heteroskedasticities in both dimensions. When the idiosyncratic errors are uncorrelated and homoskedastic, stronger results are obtained. For large N but fixed T, a necessary and sufficient condition for consistency is found"

Does Foreign Ownership Contribute to Sound Banks in Emerging Markets? The Latin American Experience,IASE,2001,"Foreign bank entrants into emerging markets are usually thought to improve the condition and performance of acquired institutions, and more generally to enhance local financial stability. We use bank-specific data for a range of Latin American countries since the mid- 1990s to address elements of this claim. Across the seven largest countries, we find that the financial strength ratings of local banks acquired by foreign entities generally show slight improvement relative to their domestic counterparts. Our more in-depth case studies of Chile, Colombia, and Argentina do not indicate striking differences in health between larger foreign and domestic retail-oriented banks (although state banks are noticeably weaker). However, foreign banks often had higher average loan growth, higher average provisioning expense, and greater loss-absorption capacity. These results suggest that foreign ownership may provide important positive influences on the stability and development of emerging market banking systems."

This paper examines the impact of this event on the stochastic properties of the transmission of shocks between Argentina and Mexico. The paper shows that there is a statistically significant change in the propagation of shocks the day the upgrade was announced. Furthermore, it is found that the parameters that shifted are those explaining the diffusion of shocks through the means, while the transmission through the variances remained stable. From the methodological point of view, the paper offers an identification procedure based on conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) that solves the problem of estimation in a simultaneous equations model."
The Exchange Rate Mismatching in a General Equilibrium Approach,IASE,2001,"A general equilibrium model is built to explain how exchange rate volatility smoothing policies may bring a Pareto-improvement for a small open economy. The model shows that this may occur when the home economy is paying a large spread on the default risk-free world interest rate and market imperfections, such as nontradable goods and imperfect information, prevent home economy’s Þrms from internalizing all beneÞts and costs of the exchange rate risk realignment into their allocative decisions. The reason is that the wealth volatility of an individual Þrm impacts on both its foreign credit’s supply and demand curves and then on the interest rate it pays on its foreign liabilities."
The Exchange Rate Regime and the Currency Composition of Corporate Debt: The Mexican Experience,IASE,2001,"This paper analyses the effect that the change from a fixed to a floating exchange rate regime that took place in Mexico in December 1994, had on the currency composition of corporate debt. In particular, the paper asks whether a fixed exchange rate regime biases corporate borrowing towards foreign currency, due to an implicit exchange rate guarantee given by the government. Therefore, under a predetermined regime firms will not fully internalize their exchange rate risk and, they will be more likely to engage in balance sheet mismatches than under a floating regime. We study the main determinants of foreign currency borrowing of those firms listed in the Mexican Stock Exchange from 1992 to 2000 to test whether balance sheet currency mismatches fell after the adoption of the floating exchange rate regime. The result found, support the view that the floating exchange rate regime has been useful in reducing exchange rate exposure."

A Theory of Rational Inflationary Inertia,IFM,2001,"This paper develops a theory of inflationary intertia based on forward looking staggered price setting in the nontradable goods sector of a small open economy. Unlike current theories of sticky prices, transitions to a lower steady state inflation rate take time even if they are fully credible, and they are associated with significant nontradables output losses. The same is true for temporary programs, but for a sufficiently long duration such programs are characterized by nontradables recessions at the beginning and the end of the program and a full recovery of output in between. Empirical results using Mexican data are consistent with the theory."
Exchange Rate Pass-Through into Import Prices: A Macro or Micro Phenomenon,IFM,2001,"Exchange rate pass-through is viewed as an important consideration in the choice of monetary policy regimes for countries. Some argue that exchange rate pass-through – along with price over cost markups in general – also are influenced by monetary policy outcomes, for example with lower price pass-through rates due to the lower inflation rates achieved in many countries. This paper contributes substantially to this debate. First, we provide extensive cross-country and time-series evidence on levels and changes in import price sensitivity to exchange rates. Second, we examine the role of macro-fundamentals versus industry structure in explaining the trajectories of pass-through coefficients across countries. Changes in macroeconomic variables are associated with changes in pass-through rates: higher inflation and exchange rate volatility are associated with higher pass-through of exchange rates into import prices. However, for OECD countries the more important determinants of pass-through are microeconomic and related to the composition of imports. The sizable shift away from Energy and into Manufactured Products in import share have led to substantial changes in the pass-through rates on aggregated import bundles."
International Dimensions of Optimal Monetary Policy,IFM,2001,"This paper provides a baseline general-equilibrium model of optimal monetary policy among interdependent economies with monopolistic firms that set prices one period in advance. Strict adherence to inward-looking policy objectives such as the stabilization of domestic output cannot be optimal when firms’ markups are exposed to currency fluctuations. Such policies induce excessive volatility in exchange rates and foreign sales revenue, leading exporters to set higher prices in response to higher profit risk. In general, optimal rules trade off a larger domestic output gap against lower import prices. Monetary rules in a world Nash equilibrium lead to less exchange rate volatility relative to both inward-looking rules and discretionary policies, even when the latter do not suffer from any inflationary (or deflationary) bias. Gains from international monetary cooperation are related in a non-monotonic way to the degree of exchange rate pass-through."
To Float or to Trail: Evidence on the Impact of Exchange Rate Regimes,IFM,2001,"We study the relationship between exchange rate regimes and economic growth for a sample of 154 countries over the post-Bretton Woods period (1974-1999), using a new de facto classification of regimes based on the actual behavior of the relevant macroeconomic variables. In contrast with previous studies, we find that, for developing countries, less flexible exchange rate regimes are strongly associated with slower growth, as well as with greater output volatility. For industrial countries, on the contrary, regimes do not appear to have any significant impact on growth. The results are robust to endogeneity corrections and a number of alternative specifications borrowed from the growth literature."

Optimal Time-Consistent Monetary Policy with State-Dependant Pricing,ME,2001,"In the previous work we have studied optimal time-consistent monetary policy in an economy where prices are sticky due to Taylor-type price setting by monopolistically competitive firms. In this environment a monetary policy has the incentive to run an expansionary monetary policy with high inflation in order to reduce the distortion implied by the mark-up pricing of firms. On the other hand, running an inflationary policy introduces a relative price distortion which lowers welfare. With full commitment, the second effect tends to dominate and the policy authority pursues a low inflation policy. Without commitment, a policy maker tends to discount the effects of the relative price distortion, since his own actions affect only a fraction of the price distribution whereas the rest is determined by past or future policy makers. This tends to raise the equilibrium inflation rate in the economy without commitment. In this paper we take the analysis one step forward and allow the price setters to respond to a high inflation environment by increasing the frequency at which they adjust prices."

The Output Gap and Optimal Monetary Policy,ME,2001,"In a standard New Keynesian model, a discretionary and myopic central bank concerned with stabilizing inflation and changes in the output gap will implement a monetary policy that replicates the optimal, timeless perspective, precommitment policy. By stabilizing output gap changes, the central bank imparts inertia into output and inflation that is absent under pure discretion. Even a fully optimizing (i.e., non-myopic) central bank operating in a discretionary policy environment achieves better social outcomes if it focuses on inflation and output gap changes rather than the level of the gap. An output gap targeting regime is found to always dominate inflation targeting and to dominate nominal income targeting except when inflation is primarily backward-looking or the social weight on output gap fluctuations is small. Because the output gap change is equal to output growth minus growth in potential, the analysis helps explain why recent authors have found that nominal income growth targeting may be superior to inflation targeting, as nominal income growth depends, in part, on real output growth."

We analyze individual seller and potential buyers behavior within property transaction histories. This leads us to establish a number of stylized facts pertaining specifically to the timing and terms of agreement in housing transactions, and more generally, to the sequence of events that occur from initial listing to sale agreement."
"Home is Where the Equity Is: Liquidity, Constraints, Refinancing and Consumption",PERE,2001,"This paper documents the extent to which homeowners use housing equity to smooth their marginal utility of consumption over time. Unlike drawing down other forms of saving, accessing accumulated home equity can be quite costly. As a result, households accumulating home equity could be liquidity constrained in the sense that they would like to access this equity to fund consumption but are unwilling to pay the costs to do so. Theoretically and empirically, a key distinction can be drawn between those refinancing their home mortgage to improve their wealth position from those who had a consumption smoothing motivation to refinance. Incorporating characteristics of a mortgage into a traditional permanent income model with exogenous liquidity constraints, one can understand household refinancing behavior in a world where mortgage interest rates are historically high and rising-up to now, an empirical puzzle. This model predicts a large consumption stimulus as mortgage rates are reduced allowing liquidity constrained households to more easily access their accumulated home equity. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, households that experienced a negative income shock and who had limited liquid assets to draw upon are shown to have been 19 percent more likely to refinance in the early 1990s. On average, liquidity constrained households converted over 60 percent of the equity they removed while refinancing into current consumption as mortgage rates plummeted between 1991 and 1994. In contrast, no such behavior was found in non-liquidity constrained refinancers. There was a corresponding stimulus of at least $18 billion from the refinancing activity of liquidity constrained households during the 1991-1994 period."
Home Ownership and the Duration of Unemployment: A Test of the Oswald Hypothesis,PERE,2001,"The last five years has seen the appearance of a substantial number of papers of the social implications of tenure choice. While the bulk of these papers suggest that owner-occupied housing produces social benefits, Andrew Oswald maintains that it also produces a social cost: unemployment. Oswald showed a correlation between homeownership and unemployment both within and across countries. These results have been confirmed by Nickell and Layard (OECD countries) and Green and Hendershott (US states). Oswald’s method, however, suffers from two potential drawbacks: selectivity bias and aggregation bias. In order to address both these biases, we track through time individual households with people who enter unemployment, and we attempt to control for selectivity bias. We find some evidence that earners of homeowning households who become unemployed find work less quickly than do earners of renter households. However, the impact is only an eighth of that reported by Oswald and others using aggregate data."
Owner-Occupied Housing as Insurance Against Rent Risk,PERE,2001,"One frequently overlooked but potentially important benefit to homeownership is avoiding the uncertainty of renting. Homeowning, with its long-term fixed-rate mortgage and owner-determined maintenance costs, provides a predictable way of paying for housing services. With renting, the long-term cost of obtaining housing is unknown. We show in a simple stylized model that risk-averse people should be willing to pay a premium over the capitalized rental value for a house to own it solely to avoid rent uncertainty. Using data from the Current Population Survey matched to MSA-level rent data, we find that the rent insurance benefit of owning significantly increases the homeownership rate: a one standard deviation increase in the effective rent variance would lead to a 2.4 to 3.0 percentage point increase in the homeownership rate. Older households are particularly sensitive to rent risk, with people aged 65 residing in places with above-median rent variance 3.8 percent more likely to be homeowners than people of the same age in low rent variance MSAs. Confirming that this effect is due to the insurance value of homeowning, the probability of homeownership drops most rapidly with age for elderly who live in high rent variance places, consistent with their insurance value declining with their remaining lifetimes. Finally, we find evidence that some of the insurance benefit of homeowning shows up in the multiple of rents people are willing to pay for houses. When MSAs have a one standard deviation higher rent variance their house prices increase 1.3 to 4.5 percent relative to the rental value of the housing stock."

An Empirical Test of a Contingent Claims Lease Valuation Model,AMRE,2002,"Though there are several theoretical lease pricing models, they have not been systematically estimated or tested using real data. The existing empirical literature on leases typically tries to explain one period’s lease payment, ignoring how fast those payments are scheduled to grow, or whether the lease contains option features. This paper bridges the gap between the two literatures by providing the first empirical investigation of an internally consistent lease pricing model. We develop a no-arbitrage based valuation model that allows us to calculate each lease’s NPV taking into account both the contractual payment amounts and any embedded options. Using a proprietary data set of several hundred leases from suburban malls in 11 states, we then compare the NPV of each lease with various characteristics of the leases and underlying properties, to see what characteristics are important, and how the underlying valuation model can be improved."
"Home Ownership: Volatile Housing Prices, Low Labor Mobility and High Income Dispersion",AMRE,2002,"We develop a dynamic stochastic equilibrium model of a city with two locations where heterogeneous households make joint location and tenure mode decisions. To investigate the effect of homeownership on equilibrium prices and allocations, we compare the response of this model economy to a population shock with that of a rental-only version. This comparison yields three results. First,  homeownership adds to the volatility of the housing market. Second, homeownership enables more relatively poor households to remain in the desirable location at the expense of newcomers. Third, homeownership may amplify the dispersion of household income within a location. These results are driven by the fact that homeownership makes the ranking of households according to wealth differ from the ranking of households according to income. Next, we introduce securities in the model that eliminate the market incompleteness inherent in the ownership economy. We show that such securities can lead to a more volatile housing market."
Optimal Valuation of Claims on Noisy Real Assets: Theory and Application,AMRE,2002,"A theory for valuing claims on noisy real assets is developed and applied. Central to the theory is determination of the dynamics for the best estimate of real asset value. The dynamics of the value estimate are shown to differ from the dynamics of the true asset value only in the arrival rate of information. The rate of information arrival in the value estimate can be faster or slower than information arrival in the true asset value, which can lead to unexpected outcomes in the valuation and exercise of options on noisy real assets. The theory we develop is illustrated through an application. An imperfectly competitive market for real estate development is examined, in which agents compete over the timing of lead investment. Information spillover and free-rider incentives are shown to cause significant delay in lead investment. Delay together with a competitive response once lead investment has occurred explain observed patterns of development in gentrified urban land markets and multi-stage development projects."

When Should Borrowers Refinance Their Mortgages?,AMRE,2002,"We develop an analytically tractable option pricing model of a mortgage holders refinancing behavior. This reduces to the choice of an optimal interest rate differential. At this optimal differential, the value of the interest saved equals the sum of refinancing costs and the difference between the old ‘in the money’ refinancing option that is implicitly given up at the refinancing and the new ‘out of the money’ refinancing option that is implicitly acquired. For a reasonable range of parameter values, we calculate the differential to be bounded below by 100 basis points. Using a unique panel data set from a large financial institution, we find that during the 1990’s over half of refinancers did so at differentials of 100 basis points or fewer. We further estimate that the fraction of early refinancers in the whole population is on the order of 30%. We conjecture that the pattern of early refinancing may arise because mortgage holders ignore the option value of waiting to refinance; rather, they choose to refinance at the point where the net present value of interest saved is equal to the refinancing cost. This behavior is consistent with the advice of most popular finance books and websites"
A Shrinkage Approach to Model Uncertainty and Asset Allocation,AP,2002,"Aversion to uncertainty about an asset-pricing model may lead investors to hold a portfolio that is inefficient for probability distributions estimated from any prior beliefs in the model. The shrinkage approach explicitly shows how prior beliefs affect the estimated distribution and helps to solve the optimal portfolio for uncertainty-averse investors. Using the shrinkage approach, U.S. investors’ home bias is measured to be 0.9 on a scale from 0 to 1. Uncertainty about the world equilibrium model does not justify the strong home bias because the diversified world market portfolio is still optimal for uncertainty-averse investors."

Asset Pricing with Liquidity Risk,AP,2002,"This paper studies equilibrium asset pricing with time-varying illiquidity. It is shown that a security’s required return depends on its expected illiquidity and on the covariances of its own return and illiquidity with market return and market illiquidity. This gives rise to a liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model (CAPM) with four betas (covariances). Further, if a security’s liquidity is persistent, a shock to its illiquidity results in low contemporaneous returns and high predicted future returns. The four-beta CAPM is tested cross-sectionally using the daily return and volume data on NYSE and AMEX stocks over the period 1963–1999. Robust evidence is presented in support of the model."
Bond Risk Premia,AP,2002,"This paper studies risk premia in the term structure. We start with regressions of annual holding period returns on forward rates. We find that a single factor, which is a tent-shaped function of forward rates, can predict one-year bond excess returns with an R 2 up to 40%. Though the return forecasting factor has a clear business cycle correlation, it does not forecast output, and business cycle variables do not forecast bond returns. The return forecasting factor does forecast stock returns, about as much as it would a 7 year duration bond. Its forecast power is retained in the presence of the dividend price ratio and the yield spread."
Comovement,AP,2002,"A number of studies have identi ed patterns of positive correlation of returns, or comovement, among different traded securities. We distinguish three views of such comovement. The traditional ""fundamentals"" view explains the comovement of securities through positive correlations in the rational determinants of their values, such as cash ows or discount rates. ""Category-based"" comovement occurs when investors classify different securities into the same asset class and shift resources in and out of this class in correlated ways. A related phenomenon of ""habitat-based"" comovement arises when a group of investors restricts its trading to a given set of securities, and moves in and out of that set in tandem. We present models of these different views of comovement, and then assess them empirically using data on stock inclusions into and deletions from the S&P 500 index. Index changes are noteworthy because they change a stock's category and investor clientele (habitat), but do not change its fundamentals. We find that when a stock is added to the index, its beta and R-squared with respect to the index increase, while its beta with respect to stocks outside the index falls. The converse happens when a stock is deleted. These results are broadly supportive of the category and habitat views of comovement, but not of the fundamentals view. More generally, we argue that these non-traditional views may help explain other instances of comovement in the data."

Sequential Optimal Portfolio Performance: Market and Volatility Timing,AP,2002,"This paper studies the economic benefits of return predictability by analyzing the impact of market and volatility timing on the performance of optimal portfolio rules. Using a model with time-varying expected returns and volatility, we form optimal portfolios sequentially and generate out-of-sample portfolio returns. We are careful to account for estimation risk and parameter learning. Using S&P 500 index data from 1980-2000,  we find that a strategy based solely on volatility timing uniformly outperforms market timing strategies, a model that assumes no predictability and the market return in terms of certainty equivalent gains and Sharpe ratios. Market timing strategies perform poorly due estimation risk, which is the substantial uncertainty present in estimating and forecasting expected returns."

The impact irrational traders have on equilibrium prices is important in determining their long-run fortunes; in particular, we find that irrational traders with very little wealth and CRRA preferences may still have a large impact on stock prices. However, absent intermediate consumption and rational traders with logarithmic preferences, irrational traders with beliefs mildly different from the true probabilities can survive in the long run. In the presence of intermediate consumption, we show that under fairly realistic conditions irrational traders do not survive or have a long term price impact, but that these results are sensitive to assumptions about preferences and the aggregate endowment."

The Interview sample follows survey households over four calendar quarters and consists of retrospectively asked information about monthly expenditures on durable and non-durable goods. The Diary sample interviews households for two consecutive weeks and includes detailed information about frequently purchased items (food, personal cares and household supplies). Each survey has its own questionnaire and sample. We exploit information from one sample as an instrument for the other to derive a correction for the measurement error affecting observed measures of consumption. We use the implications of our findings as a test for the permanent income hypothesis."

The Response of Consumption Growth to Expected Future Income Growth: Synthetic Panel Evidence,CEX,2002,"The main contribution of this paper is to show that consumers are forward-looking to a degree that some economists may find surprising. Using synthetic panel data from 1980-1999 on household consumption and income constructed from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) and the Current Population Survey (CPS), the paper shows that consumption growth forecasts income groths as much as six years in advance of its realization. Consumption growth forecasts both business cycle variation in income growth and longer terms trends such as the expanding icnome gap between the least and most educated. The paper's use of micro data allows it to rule out competing stories for the forecasting power of consumption growth over the life cycle and across education groups is documented; the forecasting power of consumption growth is concentrated at longer lags for households with more educated and more middle-aged male heads. In addition to the potential policy relevance of many of the results in this paper, its findings serve generally to inform our choice of models of household behavior."
A Theory of Partnerships,CF,2002,"We compare the costs and benefits of partnerships relative to the corporate form of organization. We show that organizing as a partnership can be desirable in human-capital intensive industries where product quality is hard to observe. The theory explains the relative scarcity of partnerships outside of professional service industries such as law, accounting, medicine, investment banking, architecture, advertising, and consulting. It also explains features of partnerships such as up-or-out promotion systems, the use of non-compete clauses, motives for profit sharing as well as recent trends in professional service industries."
Corporate Stability and Economic Growth,CF,2002,"Greater instability in a country's list of top corporations is associated with faster economic growth. This faster growth is primarily due to faster growth in total factor productivity, for greater instability in the list of top firms is actually associated with slower capital  accumulation. These findings are consistent with the view that the creative destruction that underlies economic growth through increased productivity requires a turnover in the list of top corporations. Productivity improvement appears to be tied to the rapid growth of new large firms, not to the longevity of established firms. Although corporate sector stability is not associated with (successful) government policies aimed at equalizing income distributions or avoiding economic crises, it is related to other political factors. The list of top firms is more stable in countries with bigger government, fewer rights for creditors in bankruptcy law, and financial system based on banks rather than stock markets. We argue that political rent-seeking by large established firms underlies increased corporate stability."
Courts: the Lex Mundi Project,CF,2002,"In cooperation with Lex Mundi member law firms in 109 countries, we measure and describe the exact procedures used by litigants and courts to evict a tenant for non-payment of rent and to collect a bounced check. We use these data to construct an index of procedural formalism of dispute resolution for each country. We find that such formalism is systematically greater in civil than in common law countries. Moreover, procedural formalism is associated with higher expected duration of judicial proceedings, more corruption, less consistency, less honesty, less fairness in judicial decisions, and inferior access to justice. These results suggest that legal transplantation may have led to an inefficiently high level of procedural formalism, particularly in developing countries."
Discretion in Executive Contracts: Theory and Evidence,CF,2002,"We examine the role of discretion in executive incentive contracts, and explore the trade-offs firms face in choosing among imperfect objective measures of individual performance, potentially more accurate but non-verifiable subjective measures, and overly broad objective measures of company-wide performance that include the performance of all agents in the firm. We generate implications and test the model empirically using a proprietary dataset of executive bonus plans. Consistent with our model, we find that discretion is less important in determining CEO pay than the pay of other executives. We also find that discretion is relatively important in determining executive bonuses at larger and privately held firms and that more diversified firms are relatively less likely to compensate their business unit managers based on firm-wide performance. Finally, we consider (and largely dismiss) tax-related explanations for our results."
Performance Pricing in Debt Contracts,CF,2002,"In this paper we examine the use of performance pricing in lending contracts and we examine how their use ultimately affects the interest-rate spread charged on the loan. Contracts are more likely to include this feature when re-contracting, adverse selection, and moral hazard costs are higher. Consistent with performance pricing reducing these costs, after controlling for a selectivity correction and other factors known to affect loan spreads, the  spread charged on a loan is 67 to 90 basis points lower when performance pricing is used. These results suggest that performance pricing provides an additional mechanism to other contract features, such as covenants and loan maturity, which can be used to address some of the contracting problems associated with debt. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that the design of the performance-pricing grid is an important component of the contracting process."
Price Pressure Around Mergers,CF,2002,"This paper examines the trading behavior of professional investors around 2,130 mergers announced between 1994 and 2000. We find considerable support for the existence of price pressure around mergers caused by uniformed shifts in excess demand, but that these effects are fairly short-lived, consistent with the notion that short-run demand curves for stocks are not perfectly elastic. We estimate that roughly one half of the negative announcement period stock price reaction for acquirers in stock-financed mergers reflects downward price pressure caused by merger arbitrage short selling."

The Euro Is Good After All: Corporate Evidence,CF,2002,"In this paper we study the changes in corporate valuation, investments, and financing choices induced by the formation of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in Europe. We use corporate-level data from ten countries that adopted the euro, the three EU countries that did not join EMU, as well as Norway and Switzerland. We show that the introduction of the euro has increased considerably firm values and investments in EMU countries, especially in countires that had experienced currency crises and for large firms and firms that were exposed to currency risks. The increase in investments has been financed with both debt and equity in the core EMU countries and with debt in other EMU countries. The evidence provided here supports the view that the introduction of the euro has lowered firms' cost of capital by eliminating currency risks among the countries that have adopted the common currency by further increasing capital market integration in Europe."

Anticipated Ramsey Reforms and the Uniform Taxation Principle The Role of International Financial Markets,EFCE,2002,"This paper studies the role of asset-market completeness for the properties of optimal policy. A suitable framework for this purpose is the small open economy with complete international asset markets. For in this environment changes in policy represent country-specific risk diversifiable in world markets. Our main finding is that the fundamental public finance principle whereby when taxes on all final goods are available, it is optimal to tax final goods uniformly fails to obtain. In general, uniform taxation is optimal because it amounts to a nondistorting tax on fixed factors of production. In the open economy this principle failes because when households can insure against the risk of a policy reform, initial private asset holdings are contingent on actual policy and thus no longer represent an inelastically supplied source of income. Two further differences between optimal policy in the closed and open economies with complete markets are: (a) In the open economy, optimal consumption and income tax rates are unchanged in response to government purchases shocks. By contrast, in the closed economy tax rates do respond to innovations in public spending. (b) In the open economy, the Friedman rule is optimal only in the Ramsey planner has access to consumption taxes. In the absence of consumption taxes, deviations from the Friedman rule are large. On the other hand, in the closed economy, the availability of either consumption or income taxes suffices to render the Friedman rule optimal."

Did Sunspot Forces Cause the Great Depressions,EFCE,2002,"We apply a dynamic general equilibrium model to the period of the Great Depression. In particular, we examine a modification of the real business cycle model in which the possibility of indeterminacy of equilibria arises. In other words, agents' self-fullfiling expectations can serve as a primary impulse behind fluctuations. We find that the model. driven only by these measured sunspot shocks, can explain well the entire Depression era. That is, the decline from 1929-1932, the subsequent slow recovery, and the recession that occurred in 1937-1938."

Monetary Policy Rules in the Open Economy: Effects of Welfare and Business Cycles,EFCE,2002,"This paper computes welfare maximizing Taylor-style interest rate rulers, in a business cycle model of a small open economy. The model assumes staggered price setting and shocks to domestic producitivity, to the world interest rate, to world inflation, and to the uncovered interest rate parity condition. Optimized policy rules have a pronounced anti-inflation stance and entail significant nominal and real exchange rate volatility. The country responds to an increase in external volatility by holding more foreign assets. The policy rule affects the variance and the mean of consumption. The effect on the mean matters significantly for welfare."

Nominal Price Versus Asset Price Stabilization,EFCE,2002,"This paper studies the optimal response of monetary policy under commitment to a distortionary shocks to firms' investment demand. We consider a model with nominal price rigidity and convex investment adjustment costs. We document the desirability of and the trade-off between nominal price and asset price stabilization in response to this shock. Optimal policy is contractionary in response to an inefficient boom in investment and asset prices. By tightening policy, the monetary authority depresses the capital rental rate, partially offsetting the increased demand for investment, which reduces value of installed capital and stabilizes asset prices. Relative to the optimal policy, nominal price stabilization generates short-run overinvestment and aseet price inflation. In this and other sticky price models, nominal price inflation measures labor market distortion. The market price of the capital stock, through marginal q, usefully summarizes capital market distortion. We calculate signficant relative welfare gains from following the optimal policy instead of nominal price stabilization in response to shock."

The Effects of Policy Shocks in a Monetary Business Cycle Model with Unemployment,EFCE,2002,
The Great Demand Depression,EFCE,2002,"This paper entertains the notion that disturbances on the demand side play a central role in our understanding of the Great Depression. In fact, Euler equation residuals identify a series of unusually large negative demand shocks that appeared to have hit U.S. economy during the 1930s. Measured demand shocks are applied to a dynamic general equilibrium model. Size and sequence of shocks can generate a pattern of the model economy is not unlike data. The artificial economy is able to account for the lion's share of the decline in economic activity and is able to exaggerate realistic persistence."
The Time Consistency of Optimal Monetary Policy with Heterogeneous Agents,EFCE,2002,"This paper studies the structure and time consistency of optimal monetary policy from a public finance perspective in an economy where agents differ in transaction patterns and asset holdings. I find that heterogeneity breaks the link between lack of government commitment and high inflation which characterizes representative agent models of optimal fiscal, and monetary policy. Even under commitment, it may be optimal to depart from Friedman's rule for setting nominal interest rates. Moreover, optimal monetary and fiscal policy are time consistent. Time consistency does not require outstanding nominal claims on the government to be zero. If the Friedman rule is optimal, time consistency is ensured even if the government cannot issue real and nominal debt of all maturities. I relate these findings to key historical episodes of inflation and deflation"

An Examination of Heterogeneous Beliefs with a Short Sale Constraint,EFEL,2002,"We use a calibrated dynamic general equilibrium economy with heterogenous beliefs to study the effects of a short-sale constraint on stock prices, stock price volatility, and interest rates. We find large stock price and volatility effects from heterogenous beliefs. When we introduce a stock short-sale constraint, we find small additional stock price valuation effects because of large and offsetting effects on interest rates and Sharpe ratios."
Beyond the Cost of Price Adjustment: Investments in Pricing Capital,EFEL,2002,"The literature on costs of price adjustment has long argued that changing prices is a complex and costly process. In fact, some authors have suggested that we should think of firms' price-setting activities as ""producing"" prices, similar to the way firms use production processes to produce goods and services. In this paper we explore one natural extension of this view, that besides observing costs of price adjustment, we should also expect to see firm-level investments in capital expenditures into these ""pricing"" production processes. We coin the term ""pricing production"" for these investments, and suggest that they can improve the efficiency of the ""pricing production"" activities by both reducing the costs of adjusting prices, and improving the effectiveness of price adjustments in future periods. Using two types of data sources, we find compelling evidence of the existence as well as the importance of pricing capital in firms. The existence of firm-level ""pricing capital"" has the potential of fundamentally altering the way we think about pricing and price adjustment in many ares of eocnomics. It suggests looking toward the ""pricing capital"" to decipher the likely degree and causes of price rigidity and its variaton across price setters, markets, and industries. Moreover, ""pricing capital"" introduces a new, higher-level, pricing decision made by individual firms. Decisions to invest in pricing capital compete with traditional capital investments in plant, equipment, and R&D. Furthermore, since pricing capital is a choice variable, it implies that costs of price adjustment often used in models of price rigidity are endogenous. As such, pricing capital offers new insights into the micro-foundations of the costs of price adjustment. The most provocative implication of the new theory of pricing, however, is that the allocative efficiency of the price system may be determined endogenously by individual price setters who choose whether and how much to invest in pricing capital."
Borrowing Costs And The Demand For Equity Over The Life Cycle,EFEL,2002,"We analyze consumption and portfolio behavior in a life-cycle model with borrowing costs that exceed the risk-free investment return. We calibrate the model to U.S. data on life-cycle income profiles, the cost of borrowing and returns on risk-free and equity securities. Even a modest wedge between borrowing costs and the risk-free return dramatically shrinks the demand for equity. When the cost of borrowing equals or exceeds the expected return on equity - the relevant case according to the data - households hold no equity during much of the life cycle. The correlation between consumption growth and equity returns is low at all ages. Risk aversion estimates based on the standard excess return formulation of the consumption Euler Equation are greatly upward biased. The bias diminishes, but remains large, for ""samples"" of households with positive equity holdings. The demand for equity is non-monotonic in the borrowing costs, risk aversion and the magnitude of undiversifiable income risk."
Capital Reallocation and Liquidity,EFEL,2002,"This paper studies the cyclical properties of capital reallocation and capital liquidity. We show that the amount of capital reallocation and the benefits to reallocation vary at the business cycle frequency. The amount of capital reallocation is procyclical. In contrast, the benefits to capital reallocation appear countercyclical. We measure the amount of reallocation using data on gross flows of capital and the benefits to capital reallocation using the cross sectional dispersion of total factor productivity, capacity utilization, and Tobin’s q. We study a calibrated model of an economy where capital reallocation is costly and impute the cost of reallocation which is consistent with the amount of reallocation in the data. We find that the cost of reallocation needs to vary countercyclically to generate the observed joint cyclical properties of reallocation and dispersion. The cyclical variation in this cost is interpreted as variation in the liquidity of capital."
Corporate Finance and the Term Structure of Interest Rates,EFEL,2002,"A tractable dynamic equilibrium model of interest rate determination in the market for loanable funds is presented, in which procyclical movements in interest rates are driven primarily by changes in corporate earnings rather than by shocks to the expected marginal rate of transformation. The short-term interest rate is the price at which savers supply funds to the corporate sector. However, unlike neoclassical models, we assume that firms are run by managers whose interests conflict with those of shareholders. Managers are empire-builders who prefer to invest all free cash flow rather than distributing it to shareholders. Shareholders are aware of this problem but it is costly for them to intervene to increase earnings payouts. Firms with more cash invest more. Variation in investment and interest rates is driven partly by expected future productivity, but mostly by current corporate cash flow. Aggregate investment and the short-term interst rate are highest at business cycle peaks, while term spread is lowest at these times."
External Finance Constraints and the Intertemporal Pattern of Intermittent Investment,EFEL,2002,"Do external finance constraints affect the timing of large, indivisible investment projects? Simulations of a model with fixed capital-stock adjustment costs establish the hypothesis that external finance constraints lower a firm's investment hazard: the probability of undertaking a large project today as a function of the time since the last project. Hazard model estimation that controls for productivity and adjustment costs supports this hypothesis. Small firms that do no pay dividends have significantly lower hazards than small firms that do; small stand-alone firms have significantly lower hazards than small segments of conglomerates, and accumulation of liquid assets raises hazards."
Financial Intermediation with Heterogeneous Agents: Transitional Dynamics and Policy Responses,EFEL,2002,"The paper studies loan activity in a context where banks have to follow Basle Accord type rules and need to find financing with the households. Loan activity typically decreases when investment returns of entrepreneurs decline, and we study which type of policy could revigorate an economy in bad shape. We find that active monetary policy increases loans even when the economy is in good shape, while introducing active capital requirement policy can be effective as well if it implies tightening of regulation in bad times."
How Senstive is Investment? Very(when the data are well measured),EFEL,2002,"We use a unique data set covering over 30,000 Italian firms over 10 years to estimate the interest sensitivity of investment. This data set has three special attributes. First, it includes information that allows us to link firms to the banks from which they are borrowing. Second, the terms of the lending agreements are quite accurately recorded. Finally, we have balance sheet and other cost information about the banks. Together these features allow us determine a marginal financing cost for firms and to identify fluctuations in these costs that are supply driven (and hence uncorrelated with investment demand). We exploit this supply induced variation in interest rates to estimate the interest sensitivity of investment. Our results show that: i) when ignoring endogeneity problems, the user cost of capital is estimated to have a negative effect on investment decisions but the effect is tiny and similar in magnitude to what is found in typical estimates using aggregate time series data; ii) once endogeneity is properly accounted for, the estimated effects are about 10 time larger. The elasticity of capital with respect to the user cost of capital is found to be about -1."
"Labor Market Frictions, Capital Adjustment Costs, and Stock Prices",EFEL,2002,"The subject of this paper is the joint determination of investment in capital and the hiring of labor and its consequences for stock prices. It is studied in a model with labor market frictions and capital adjustment costs. The model's quantitative implications are explored using structural estimation and calibration, with aggregate time-series data for the U.S. corporate sector. The results provide for (i) better understanding of the stochastic relationship between investment and stock prices, and (ii) the quantification of the links between labor market variables and both investment in physical capital and stock prices. The results suggest that allowing for labor market frictions to interact with capital adjustment costs leads to better performance of investment and production-based asset pricing equations. Using the estimated or calibrated convex adjustment cost function in the firms' Euler and asset pricing equations, we are able to account for the behavior of investment, hiring and asset values over the sample period. The estimated model captures the negative correlation between hiring and investment in the data. We find that hiring costs account for about 20% of firms' asset values on average and that capital adjustment costs account for most of asset volatility."
"Life Cycle Asset Allocation: A Model with Borrowing Constraints, Uninsurable Labor Income Risk and Stock Market Participation Costs",EFEL,2002,"We study life-cycle asset allocation in the presence of liquidity constraints and undiversifiable labor income risk. The model includes three different assets (cash, long-term government bonds and stocks) and it takes into account the life-cycle profile of housing expenditures. With a modest correlation between stock returns and earnings innovations, the mean share of wealth invested in stocks never exceeds 45% during working-life. Moreover, the combination of uninsurable human capital and borrowing constraints rationalizes the asset allocation puzzle of Canner, Mankiw and Weil (1997). Nevertheless we argue that asset allocation models must match another important feature of the data: a low stock market participation rate. Along this dimensions the model provides a very modest improvement, still predicting a counterfactually high participation rate. We show that this arises from the link between risk aversion and prudence, implying that explanations for the participation puzzle based on the role of background risk are unlikely to succeed."
Life Cycle Consumption and Portfolio Choice with Additive Habit Formation Preferences and Uninsurable Labor Income Risk,EFEL,2002,"I consider a life cycle model of consumption, savings and portfolio allocation for a household with additive and endogenous habit formation preferences. When the exogenous state variable follows a finite–state Markov process, I characterize analytically the admissible habit–wealth region for every age and solve the problem numerically in this region. The boundary of the admissible region depends on the worst possible path of future labor income and on the habit persistence parameter and does not depend on the probability of the worst case path. The distance to the admissible boundary and the current habit jointly determine the optimal savings policy and portfolio allocation. This feature of the model may be helpful in addressing several standing issues in the life cycle portfolio choice literature. For example, it may shed light on the slow de-cumulation of savings by the old, if one considers a possibility of drastic reduction of disposable income due to sudden increase in nondiscretionary expenses (e.g. on health care). It may also help, with the introduction of severe (but unlikely) income shock due to unemployment or disability, to rationalize conservative equity portfolios and limited stock market participation observed in the data."
Liquidity Demand and Asset Pricing: Evidence from the Periodic Settlement in Japan,EFEL,2002,"It is often argued that asset pricing is influenced heavily by not fundamentals, but current demand for financial assets. One of the most important issues here is when and how asset pricing is determined primarily by current liquidity conditions. According to Holmström and Tirole [2001], when firms anticipate not financing liquidity events on their future revenues, they boost demand for short-term assets, which will mature coincidentally with the timing of liquidity events. Such asset demand may substantially lower short-term rates. This paper empirically examines this implication, using as liquidity events the periodic settlement that prevails as practice among firms in Japan. We find that assets with maturities at the settlement period are indeed more highly priced than assets with maturities beyond it."
Non Convexities in the Adjustment of Different Capital Inputs: A Firm Level Investigation,EFEL,2002,"Recent developments in investment research have highlighted the importance of non-convexities and irreversibilities in the firms' adjustment of quasi-fixed inputs. However, aggregation across capital goods may smooth out of the discountuities associated with the adjustment of individual assets. The lack of suitable data, is one of the reasons why empirical work has strongly relied on the assumption of capital homogeneity. In this paper we exploit a new data set of 1539 Italian firms which allows us to disaggregate across several capital types and consider separately purchases and sales of assets. We start from the basic disaggregation between equipment and structures and construct measures of fundamental  Q to capture investment opportunities associated with each asset. To uncover the pattern of dynamic adjustment we use non-parametric techniques to relate each individual investment to own fundamental Q."
"Optimal Financing Contracts, Investor Protection, and Growth",EFEL,2002,"Recent empirical evidence has suggested a positive association between various measures of investors protection and financial market development, and between financial market development and economic growth. We introduce investor protection in a simple extension of the two-period overlapping generations model of capital accumulation."
Regulating Exclusion from Financial Markets,EFEL,2002,"We study optimal enforcement in credit markets in which the only threat facing a defaulting borrower is restricted access to financial markets. This environment has been studied in the literature initiated by Kehoe and Levine (1993) and Kocherlakota (1996). Rather than presuppose the form of regulation in this environment, we solve for the optimal regulation and link it to observed institutional arrangements. Regulation in this environment must accomplish two objectives. First, it must prevent borrowers from defaulting on one bank and transferring their resources to another bank. Second, and less obviously, it must give banks the incentive to make sizeable loans, and to honor their promises of future credit. We establish that the optimal regulation will resemble laws governing default on debt and bankruptcy. Moreover it can be implemented in a way that does not require the regulator to have information about either the borrower or lender. Finally, the important aspect of observed bankruptcy codes is restricting fraudulent conveyance - which boils down to preventing a borrower in default from transferring their resources to another bank. Restricting the availability of credit to a defaulted borrower is not a threat in and of itself, that motivates borrowers to repay loans."

Currency Crises and Uncertainty About Fundamentals,IFM,2002,This paper extends some theoretical results of Morris and Shin (1998) concerning the role of uncertainty about fundamentals in currency crises and tests their empirical relevance using a novel approach based on the distribution of survey expectations. Econometric evidence from the Asian crisis confirms the prediction that the dispersion of expectations affects the probability of a speculative attack and that the sign of this effect depends on whether expected fundamentals are “good” or “bad.” Extensive robustness checks support the findings.
"Estimating Returns to Emerging Market Lending, 1970-2000",IFM,2002,"The stock market appreciates by an average of 24 percent in real dollar terms when countries attempt to stabilize annual inflation rates that are greater than 40 percent. In contrast, the average market response is 0 when the pre-stabilization rate of inflation is less than 40 percent. These results suggest that the potential long-run benefits of stabilization may dominate short-run costs at high levels of inflation, but at low to moderate levels of inflation, benefits may be offset by costs in a present value sense. Stock market responses also help predict the change in inflation and output in the year following all 81 stabilization efforts."
Exchange Rates and Fundamentals,IFM,2002,"Standard economic models hold that exchange rates are influenced by fundamental variables such as relative money supplies, outputs, inflation rates and interest rates. Nonetheless, it has been well documented that such variables little help predict changes in floating exchange rates — that is, exchange rates follow a random walk. We show that the data do exhibit a related link suggested by standard models – that the exchange rate helps predict fundamentals. We also show analytically that in a rational expectations present value model, an asset price manifests near random walk behavior if fundamentals are I(1) and the factor for discounting future fundamentals is near one. We suggest that this may apply to exchange rates."

On the Benefits of Capital Account Liberalization,IFM,2002,"Standard theoretical arguments tell us that countries with relatively little capital benefit from financial integration as foreign capital flows in and speeds up the process of convergence. We show in calibrated exercises that conventionally measured welfare gains from this type of convergence appear relatively limited for the typical emerging country. The traditional theory, then, does not seem to provide a sufficient rationale for capital account liberalization. Our approach emphasizes instead that poor countries face a number of distortions that prevent the allocation of production inputs to their most efficient uses. Liberalization of the capital account should then be understood as a means to eliminate or reduce these distortions, and it is this effect of liberalization that may create first order gains. As an illustration of this approach, we present a model in which capital account account liberalization improves domestic allocative efficiency because of its effect on property rights. Our theory has implications for the political economy of financial integration. First, we show that politicians may open the capital account as a way of ""locking-in"" domestic reform, even when they cannot commit to either decision. Second, traditional trade arguments (e.g. Stolper-Samuelson) would argue that in capital-scarce countries, domestic capitalists would oppose financial integration as it reduces the return to capital, while workers would typically favor it. The political economy of financial integration does not seem to reflect these predictions. Often, domestic capitalists favor integration while workers may or may not oppose it."
One Reason Countries Pay their Debts: Renegotiation and International Trade,IFM,2002,
"Order Flows, Exchange Rates and Asset Prices",IFM,2002,"We develop an equilibrium model of international capital flows in which risk-averse home and foreign investors invest in both home and foreign equity markets with incomplete exchange rate risk trading. Exchange rates are determined by a price-elastic foreign exchange supply, so that private order flows move the exchange rate in line with recent evidence. The equilibrium prices for domestic and foreign equity and the exchange rate are obtained under asset market clearing. We derive the implications of incomplete exchange-rate risk trading for the correlation structure between asset returns and the exchange rate. The theoretical implications are confronted with the data."

However, at the same time, statistical analyses of lagged representations of the economy, such as VARs, often have not rejected the null of structural stability. These two sets of empirical results appear to contradict the Lucas critique. This paper provides a reconciliation by showing that the apparent policy invariance of reduced forms is consistent with the magnitude of historical policy shifts and the relative insensitivity of the reduced forms of plausible forward-looking macroeconomic specifications to policy shifts."
Does the Fed Possess Inside Information About the Economy?,ME,2002,"A number of recent papers have hypothesized that the Federal Reserve possesses information about the future course of inflation and output that is unknown to the private sector. We propose and conduct two direct tests of this hypothesis: 1) can monetary policy surprises improve the private sector’s ex ante forecasts of subsequent macroeconomic statistical releases, and 2) does the private sector revise its forecasts of macroeconomic statistical releases in response to these monetary policy surprises? We find that the Federal Reserve does not possess inside information about any major macroeconomic statistical release, with one notable exception: Industrial Production, which the Federal Reserve produces."
Fair Treatment and Inflation Persistence,ME,2002,"Most wage-contracting models with rational expectations fail to replicate the persistence in inflation observed in the data. We develop a wage-contracting model in a setting following Bhaskar (1990) in which workers are concerned about being treated fairly: they care disproportionately more about being paid less than other, identical workers than they care about being paid more than them. This model generates a continuum of equilibria, where workers want to match the wage set by other workers. If workers’ expectations are based on the past behavior of wage growth, these beliefs will be self-fulfilling and thus rational. Moreover, the multiplicity of equilibria is consistent with the idea that there may be a natural range of unemployment, rather than a single natural rate. We estimate the model on quarterly U.S. data over the period 1955-2000. We find evidence that the dynamics of the Phillips curve do change below unemployment rates of 4.7 and above rates of 6.5 percent."
"Imperfect Knowledge, Inflation Expectations, and Monetary Policy",ME,2002,"This paper investigates the role that imperfect knowledge about the structure of the economy plays in the formation of expectations, macroeconomic dynamics, and the efficient formulation of monetary policy. Economic agents rely on an adaptive learning technology to form expectations and continuously update their beliefs regarding the dynamic structure of the economy based on incoming data. The process of perpetual learning introduces an additional layer of dynamic interactions between monetary policy and economic outcomes. We find that policies that would be efficient under rational expectations can perform poorly when knowledge is imperfect. In particular, policies that fail to maintain tight control over inflation are prone to episodes in which the public’s expectations of inflation become uncoupled from the policy objective and stagflation results, in a pattern similar to that experienced in the United States during the 1970s. More generally, we show that policy should respond more aggressively to inflation under imperfect knowledge than under perfect knowledge."

Monetary Policy and Stagflation in the UK,ME,2002,"The volatile data for inflation, output, and interest rates in the United Kingdom prior to the 1990s, and the relative macroeconomic stability associated with inflation targeting, provide a rich basis for discriminating between rival explanations for the outbreak of stagflation. We examine alternative hypotheses with a New Keynesian model of aggregate demand and inflation determination, estimated on quarterly UK data for 1959–2000. Our model features IS and Phillips curves based on optimizing behavior, and fully incorporates the distinction between detrended output and the output gap stressed by optimizing analysis. Using simulations of our model as well as information on the ‘real-time’ views of policy makers, we test alternative explanations for the outbreak of inflation in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s. We find that inaccurate estimates of the degree of excess demand in the economy contributed significantly to the outbreak. But we also find a major role for the failure at the time to recognize the importance of monetary policy, as opposed to non-monetary devices, in controlling inflation."

"Commuting, Ricardian Rent and Housing Appreciation in Cities with Dispersed Employment and Mixed Land-Use",PERE,2002,"We study the effect of physician incentives in an HMO network. Physician incentives are controversial because they may induce doctors to take actions on behalf of patients that differ from those they would chose in the absence of incentives. We set out a theoretical framework for assessing the degree to which incentive contracts do in fact induce physicians to deviate from a standard guided only by patient interests and professional medical judgement. Our empirical evaluation of the model relies on details of the HMO’s incentive contracts, and access to the firm’s internal expenditure records. We estimate that the HMO’s incentive contract provides a typical physician an increase, at the margin, of $0.10 in income for each $1.00 reduction in medical utilization expenditures. The average response is a 5 percent reduction in medical expenditures. We also find suggestive evidence that financial incentives linked to quality measures may stimulate an improvement in measured quality."

A Parsimonious Macroeconomic Model for Asset Pricing: Habit Formation or Cross-Sectional Heterogeneity,AP,2003,"In this paper we study the asset pricing implications of a parsimonious two-agent macroeconomic model with two key features: limited participation in the stock market and heterogeneity in the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. The parameter values for the model are taken from the business cycle literature and are not calibrated to match any financial statistic. Yet, with a risk aversion of two, the model is able to explain a large number of asset pricing phenomena including all the facts matched by the external habit model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999). Examples in this list include a high equity premium and a low risk-free rate; a counter-cyclical risk premium, volatility and Sharpe ratio; predictable stock returns with coefficients and R2 values of long-horizon regressions matching their empirical  counterparts, among others. In addition the model generates a risk-free rate with low volatility (5.7 percent annually) and with high persistence. We also show that the similarity of our results to those from an external habit model is not a coincidence: the model has a reduced form representation which is remarkably similar to Campbell and Cochrane’s framework for asset pricing. However, the macroeconomic implications of the two models are quite different, favoring the limited participation model. Moreover, we show that policy analysis yields dramatically different conclusions in each framework."
An Equilibrium Model of Investment Under Uncertainty,AP,2003,"This paper analyzes the optimal investment decisions of heterogeneous firms in a competitive, uncertain environment. We characterize firms’ optimal investment strategy explicitly, and derive a closed form solution for firm value. We show that in the strategic equilibrium real option premia are significant. As a result firms delay investment, choosing optimally not to undertake some positive NPV projects. The model predicts that firm returns vary over the business cycle, with returns negatively skewed during expansions but positively skewed in recessions."
Calibrating an Agent-Based Financial Market,AP,2003,"This paper explores some of the empirical features generated in an agent-based computational stock market with market participants adapting and evolving over time. Investors view differing lengths of past information as being relevant to their investment decision making process. The interaction of these memory lengths in determining market prices creates a kind of market ecology in which it is difficult for the more stable, longer horizon agents to take over the market. What occurs is a dynamically changing market in which different types of strategies arrive and depart depending on their current relative performance, and the fraction of wealth following them. This paper analyzes several key time series features of such a market. It is calibrated to the variability and growth of dividend payments in the United States. The market generates some features which are remarkably similar to those from actual data. These include magnifying the volatility from the dividend process, inducing persistence in volatility and volume, and generating fat tailed return distributions. The market is simulated at the weekly frequency, but returns are also examined at longer horizons where they are compared with other long range results."
Consumption Risk and Cross-Sectional Returns,AP,2003,"This paper evaluates the central insight of the Consumption Capital Asset Pricing model (C-CAPM) that an asset’s expected return is determined by its equilibrium risk to consumption. Rather than measure the risk of a portfolio by the contemporaneous covariance of its return and consumption growth — as done in the previous literature on the C-CAPM and the pattern of cross-sectional returns — we measure the risk of a portfolio by its ultimate consumption risk defined as the covariance of its return and consumption growth over the quarter of the return and many following quarters. While contemporaneous consumption risk has little predictive power for explaining the pattern of average returns across the Fama and French (25) portfolios, ultimate consumption risk is highly statistically significant in explaining average returns and explains a large fraction of the variation in average returns. Aditionally, estimates of the average risk-free real rate of interest and the coefficient of relative risk aversion of the representative household based on ultimate consumption risk are more reasonable than those obtained using contemporaneous consumption risk."
Efficient Tests of Stock Return Predictability,AP,2003,"Empirical studies have suggested that stock returns can be predicted by financial variables such as the dividend-price ratio. However, these studies typically ignore the high persistence of predictor variables, which can make first-order asymptotics a poor approximation in finite samples. Using a more accurate asymptotic approximation, we propose two methods to deal with the persistence problem. First, we develop a pretest that determines when the conventional t-test for predictability is misleading. Second, we develop a new test of predictability that results in correct inference regardless of the degree of persistence and is efficient compared to existing methods. Applying our methods to US data, we find that the dividend-price ratio and the smoothed earnings-price ratio are sufficiently persistent for conventional inference to be highly misleading. However, we find some evidence for predictability using our test, particularly with the earnings-price ratio. We also find evidence for predictability with the short-term interest rate and the long-short yield spread, for which the conventional t-test leads to correct inference."
"Hedging, Stock Market Performance and Portfolio Choice",AP,2003,"We test whether hedging motives can explain stock market participation and portfolio choice using portfolio data. We use a unique dataset of Swedish investors that contains information broken down at the investor level and into various components of wealth, investor income, tax positions and investors’ demographic characteristics. Portfolio holdings are identified at the stock level. This allows us to measure the extent to which investors deliberately tilt their portfolio away from the market portfolio in order to hedge their non-financial income risk. We provide evidence that investors do not engage in hedging, but invest in stocks with which they are familiar in terms of geographical or professional proximity. We rationalize this in terms of ""familiarity"" and we provide evidence of it. We show that familiarity-based investment allows investors to earn higher returns than they would have otherwise earned if they had hedged."
"Housing Collateral, Consumption Insurance and Risk Premia",AP,2003,"In a model with housing collateral, the ratio of housing wealth to human wealth shifts the conditional distribution of asset prices and consumption growth. A decrease in house prices reduces the collateral value of housing, increases household exposure to idiosyncratic risk, and increases the conditional market price of risk. Using aggregate data for the US, we find that a decrease in the ratio of housing wealth to human wealth predicts higher returns on stocks. Conditional on this ratio, the covariance of returns with aggregate risk factors explains up to eighty percent of the cross-sectional variation in annual size and book-to-market portfolio returns."
Is Value Riskier than Growth,AP,2003,"Yes! We study the time-varying risk patterns of value and growth stocks across business cycles. We find reliable evidence that value stocks are riskier than growth stocks in bad times when the expected market risk premium is high, and to a lesser extent, growth stocks are riskier than value stocks in good times when the expected market risk premium is low. Methodologically, we measure the time-variation of risk by sorting the conditional betas on the theoretically justified expected market risk premium, as opposed to the ex post realized market excess return. Our evidence lends support to the predictions of recent rational expectations theory on the value premium."
"Private Equity Performance: Returns, Persistence and Capital Flows",AP,2003,"This paper investigates the performance of private equity partnerships using a data set of individual fund returns collected by Venture Economics. Over the sample period, average fund returns net of fees approximately equal the S&P 500 although there is a large degree of heterogeneity among fund returns. Returns persist strongly across funds raised by individual private equity partnerships. The returns also improve with partnership experience. Better performing funds are more likely to raise follow-on funds and raise larger funds than funds that perform poorly. This relationship is concave so that top performing funds do not grow proportionally as much as the average fund in the market. Finally, we show that market entry in the private equity industry is cyclical. Funds (and partnerships) started in boom times are less likely to raise follow-on funds, suggesting that these funds subsequently perform worse. Several of these results differ markedly from those for mutual funds."
The Conditional CAPM Does Not Explain Asset-Pricing Anomalies,AP,2003,"Recent studies suggest that the conditional CAPM might hold, period-by-period, and that time-varying betas can explain the failures of the simple, unconditional CAPM. We argue, however, that significant departures from the unconditional CAPM would require implausibly large time-variation in betas and expected returns. Thus, the conditional CAPM is unlikely to explain asset-pricing anomalies like book-to-market and momentum. We test this conjecture empirically by directly estimating conditional alphas and betas from short-window regressions (avoiding the need to specify conditioning information). The tests show, consistent with our analytical results, that the conditional CAPM performs nearly as poorly as the unconditional CAPM."
Capital Markets Constrain Industry Scale,CF,2003,"The paper considers an industry featuring agency problems between outside investors and entrepreneurs who manage the firms comprising the industry. In a range of circumstances, industry scale is independent of product market structure, and is determined solely by the amount of equity financing contributed by the entrepreneurs, and by the capital market’s response to possible managerial malfeasance. Thus, in the face of capital market constraints, a change in product-market concentration has no effect on market performance unless it occasions a change in the amount of inside equity financing."
Capital Reallocation and Liquidity,CF,2003,"This paper studies the cyclical properties of capital reallocation and capital liquidity. We show that the amount of capital reallocation and the benefits to reallocation vary at the business cycle frequency. The amount of capital reallocation is procyclical. In contrast, the benefits to capital reallocation appear countercyclical. We measure the amount of reallocation using data on flows of capital across firms and the benefits to capital reallocation using the cross sectional dispersion of Tobin's q, investment rates, total factor productivity, and capacity utilization. We study a caibrated model of an economy where capital reallocation is costly and impute the cost of reallocation which is consistent with the amount of reallocation in the data. We find that the cost of reallocation needs to vary countercyclically to generate the observed joint cyclical properties of reallocation and dispersion. The cyclical variation in this cost is interpreted as variation in the liquidity of capital."
Collateral Channel and Cridit Cycle: Evidence from the Land-Price Collapse in Japan,CF,2003,"This paper investigates empirically the effect of real assets as collateral on the economy. As pointed out by Kiyotaki and Moore (1997), when loans are collateralized and firms are credit constrained, the amount borrowed is determined by the value of the collateral; a decrease in the price of productive assets will therefore have a negative impact on firm investments. These effects are cumulative, which leads to credit cycles. There are potentially two major difficulties in empirically testing the relationship between collateral and firm investments. First, the value of collateral often is not observable due to the lack of active secondary markets for collateralizable assets, such as plants and machineries. Second, collateral is endogenous. For example, when firms invest they need to purchase machines and build plants, which expands their collateralizable assets. This paper deals with these two difficulties by using the land-price collapse in Japan in the early 1990s as a natural experiment. In Japan, the main form of collateral for corporate borrowing is land, the value of which is observable. In addition, between 1990 and 1993, there was a near 50% drop in land prices, which was unambiguously exogenous to any one individual firm. As firms suffer losses proportionate to their land holding, the amount of land held prior to the shock can serve as an exogenous instrument to measure collateral. I find that collateral affected Japanese firm investments in two important ways. The first is a collateral-damage effect: losses in collateral value reduced investments. The second is an indirect internal-liquidity effect: with reduced borrowing capacity, the firms had to rely more upon internally generated cash to finance their investments. In addition to the investment analysis, we use a unique dataset of matched firm-bank lending, which permits us to further examine the mechanism through which collateral affects firm investments. In particular, I investigate whether colllateral losses also leads to reduced borrowing capacities. The matched sample allows me to control for unobservable heterogeneity in the loan supply. The results show, again, a significant collateral-damage effect: banks tended to lend less to those who suffered greater collateral losses."
Competing for Securities Underwriting Mandates: Banking Relationships and Analyst Recommendations,CF,2003,"We investigate directly whether analyst behavior influenced the likelihood of banks winning underwriting mandates for a sample of 16,625 U.S. debt and equity offerings sold between December 1993 and June 2002. We control for the strength of the issuer’s investment-banking relationships with potential competitors for the mandate, for prior lending relationships, and for the endogeneity of analyst behavior and the bank’s decision to provide analyst coverage. Contrary to recent allegations, we find no evidence that aggressive analyst recommendations or recommendation upgrades increased a bank’s probability of winning an underwriting mandate once we control for analysts’ career concerns. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case. We interpret this finding as evidence that credibility is central to resolving information frictions associated with securities offerings. Overly aggressive analyst behavior undermines credibility. Differences across debt and equity sub-samples are consistent with this interpretation."
Does the Source of Capital affect Capital Structure?,CF,2003,"Empirical examinations of capital structure have led some to conclude that firms are under levered. Implicit in this argument and much of the empirical work on leverage is the assumption that the availability of incremental capital depends solely on the risk of the firm’s cash flows and characteristics of the firm. However, the same market frictions that make capital structure relevant suggest that firms may be rationed by lenders, leading some firms to appear to be under-levered relative to unconstrained firms. We examine this theory, arguing that the same characteristics that may be associated with firms being rationed by the debt markets are also associated with financial intermediaries, opposed to bond markets, being the source of a firm’s debt capital. We find that firms have significantly different leverage ratios based on whether they have access to public bond markets as measured by the firm having a debt rating. Although firms with a debt rating are fundamentally different, these differences do not explain our finding. Even after controlling for the firm characteristics previously found to determine observed capital structure and the possible endogeneity of having a bond rating, we find that firms which are able to raise debt from public markets have 40 percent more debt."
"Financial Constraints, Asset Tangibility, and Corporate Investment",CF,2003,"This paper proposes a new strategy to identify the effect of financial constraints on corporate investment. When firms are able to pledge their assets as collateral, investment and borrowing become endogenous: pledgeable assets support more borrowings that in turn allow for further investments in pledgeable assets. We show that this credit multiplier has a first-order effect on investment when firms face financing firctions. In particular, investment-cash flow sensitivities will be increasing in the degree of tangibility of constrained firms' assets. When firms are unconstrained, in contrast, investment-cash flow sensitivities are unaffected by asset tangibility. This theoretical prediction allows us to use a ""differences in differences"" approach to identify the effect of financing frictions on corporate investment: we compare the differential (marginal) effect of asset tangibility on the sensitivity of investment to cash flow across different regimes of financial constraints. Using two layers of cross-sectional contrasts sidesteps concerns that cash flows might correlate with a firm's (residual) investment opportunities when Q fails as a control. We implement out testing strategy on a large sample of firms drawn from COMPUSTAT between 1971 and 2000. The data strongly support our hypothesis about the role of asset tangibility on corporate investment under financial constraints."
Financial Contracting with Optimistic Entrepreneurs: Theory and Evidence,CF,2003,
Simple Forecasts and Paradigm Shifts,CF,2003,"We propose that agents make forecasts using overly simplified models of the world - i.e., models that only embody a subset of available information. We then go on to study the implications of learning in this environment. Our key premise is that learning is based on a model-selection criterion. Thus if a particular simple model does a poor job of forecasting over a period of time, it is eventually discarded in favor of an alternative, yet equally simple model that would have done better over the same period. This theory makes several distinctive predictions, which, for concreteness, we develop in a stock-market setting. For example, starting with symmetric and homoskedastic fundamentals, the theory yields forecastable variation in the size of the value/glamour differential, in volatility, and in the skewness of returns. Some of these features mirror familiar accounts of stock-price bubbles."
The Media and Asset Prices,CF,2003,"Does media coverage affect asset prices? If so, why? And what are the consequences? In this paper we try to answer these questions by looking at the effect media reporting has on stock market reactions to earnings announcement. We find that stock prices are most reactive to the type of earnings emphasized by the press. This effect is stronger for companies with fewer analysts and when the media outlet is more credible. Interestingly, we find that media spin tends to follow the spin promoted by the company. This is more so the fewer alternative sources of information about a company are available, the more demand for information there is, and the less reputable a newspaper is. The evidence is most consistent with a quid pro quo relation between journalists and their sources, where they receive private information in exchange for a positive spin on companies’ news."
The Power of Takeover Defenses,CF,2003,"We investigate the effects of modern takeover defenses. Following the development of the poison pill, U.S. managers’ ability to block an offer that shareholders view as attractive depends on whether managers of U.S. firms are protected by an “effective” staggered board (ESB), which prevents shareholders from replacing the full board in a single annual meeting. We test the prediction that the presence of an ESB has a considerable effect on bid outcomes and shareholder returns using a new database of all hostile takeover bids for U.S. targets in the period 1996-2002. We find that an ESB substantially increases the odds that a takeover target will remain independent. Other variables commonly thought to influence the outcome of bids – such as pre-bid poison pills, the presence of a majority of independent directors on the target board, and target CEO characteristics – appear to have a much less significant effect on outcomes than the presence of an ESB. We also find that targets that remain independent achieve, on average, significantly lower returns than acquired targets, and we find no evidence that ESBs provide countervailing benefits in the form of higher premiums for targets that are acquired. Finally, we find that having an ESB reduces the returns to target shareholders, in both the short run (12 months) and the long run (30 months), by more than 20%."
Wealth Destruction on a Massive Scale: A Study of Acquiring-firm Returns in the Merger Wave of the 1990s,CF,2003,"Acquiring-firm shareholders lost 12 cents for every dollar spent on economically significant acquisitions for a total loss of $240 billion from 1998 through 2001, whereas they lost $7 billion in all of the 1980s, or 1.5 cents per dollar spent. Though the announcement losses to acquiring-firm shareholders in the 1980s are more than offset by gains to acquired-firm shareholders, the losses of bidders exceed the gains of targets from 1998 through 2001 by 158$ billion. The 1998-2001 aggregate losses of acquiring-firm shareholders are so large because the worst acquisition announcements are associated with extremely large losses. These acquisitions represent a large fraction of the amount spent on acquisitions because they are made by large firms and are usually the largest acquisitions of these firms. Firm and deal characteristics found useful in earlier work to explain acquirer returns cannot explain these large losses. It is also not the case that highly valued firms make systematically poor acquisitions. The evidence is consistent with three possible explanations for these deals that are not mutually exclusive: (1) acquirers with overvalued equity use it to pay for acquisitions to lock in physical assets, (2) overvalued equity enables managers to pursue a growth strategy that is not in the interests of long-term shareholders, and/or (3) these acquisitions reveal to investors that firm's earnings growth will be lower than expected. In particular, most of the acquisitions with large losses involve some equity in payment, follow a period of successful acquisitions, are made close to the acquiring firm's valuation peak, are accompanied by a drop in expected earnings, and are followed by poor long-run performace."
Aggregate Risk in Japanese Equity Markets,EFCE,2003,"In the past decade Japanese households have been buffeted by some big aggregate shocks. Economic growth has slowed, unemployment risk has risen, and asset prices have fallen to levels not seen since the early 1980's. These shocks have hit both households' financial and human capital. This paper develops a framework for identifying the sources of these shocks and a way to measure how household assessments of these risks vary over time. We consider the perspective of a forward-looking risk-averse household and derive expected returns and time-varying risk premia for each risk factor. We then construct times-series of historical expected risk premia using Japanese data on industry returns. An analysis of this data provides four main findings. First, prior to 1984 expected risk premia on identified goods market shocks, monetary policy and financial market risk are all important determinants of industry level expected returns. Second, starting in 1984 households perceive that the risk from financial shocks is increasing and demand higher risk premia to hold this risk. Third, between 1987 and 1990 risk premia on monetary policy are large and positive. Monetary policy is perceived to be adding to financial risk. Fourth, in 1990 as expected risk premia on financial risk shoot up, expected risk premia on monetary policy shocks turn negative for all industry returns. As stock prices collapse between 1990 and 1995, monetary policy shocks play an important role in hedging risk emanating from the financial sector."
Asymmetric Cycles,EFCE,2003,"I estimate a model in which new technology entails random adjustment costs. Rapid adjustments may cause productivity slowdowns. These slowdowns last longer when retooling is costly. The model explains why 1. growth-rate disasters are more likely than miracles, 2. volatility of growth relates negatively to growth over time."
Corporate Governance over the Business Cycle,EFCE,2003,I provide empirical evidence that badly governed firms respond more to aggregate shocks than do well governed firms. A simple model where shareholders’ scrutiny increases when business conditions deteriorate can account for this empirical finding. The quantitative analysis suggests that the governance mechanism may explain 30% of aggregate volatility.
Dynamic Optimal Taxation with Private Infomation,EFCE,2003,"We study dynamic optimal taxation in a class of economies with private information. Constrained optimal allocations in these environments are complicated and history-dependent. Yet, we show that they can be attained as competitive equilibria in market economies supplemented with simple tax systems. The market structure in these economies is identical to that in Bewley (1986): agents can trade current consumption and risk-free claims to future consumption, subject to a budget constraint and a debt limit. The tax system describes additional transfers that the agents must make to the government. It conditions them upon only two observable characteristics of an agent: her accumulated stock of claims, or wealth, and her current labour income. It implies optimal tax functions that are not additively separable in these variables. The marginal wealth tax is negatively correlated with income and its expected value is generally positive. The marginal income tax is decreasing in wealth."
Efficiency Wages and Inter-Industry Wage Differentials,EFCE,2003,"Many empirical papers argue that a signficant portion of inter-industry wage differentials is attributable to efficiency wage considerations. This paper presents a new multi-industry shirking efficency wage model, in which detected shirkers face a monetary punishment, and examines whether it is consistent with the size and behavior of inter-industry wage differentials over time. The model suggests that: 1) small differences in detection rates can account for significant and persistent differentials, 2) high wage industries tend to have higher profits per worker and higher capital to labor ratios, and 3) inter-industry wage differentials are consistent with the empirical findings that they are generally acyclical."

Financial Intermediation in a Restructuring Economy,EFCE,2003,
Investment Planning Costs and the Effects of Fiscal and Monetary Policy,EFCE,2003,"We show that simple “New Keynesian” models with capital but without investment frictions have counterfactual predictions regarding the short-run effects of fiscal policy shocks: fiscal expansions lower output, employment, and the real interest rate in these models. We modify the model by assuming that investment projects are costly to start or stop, which is consistent with micro evidence. Adding investment planning costs restores the aggregate expenditure logic of the Keynesian Cross, and eliminates the counterfactual predictions regarding fiscal shocks. The modified model is also better able to match stylized facts on (i) the delayed effects of monetary policy shocks on output, (ii) the size of the liquidity effect, and (iii) the fact that monetary shocks change real interest rates for a significantly shorter time than they change real output. We show that convex capital adjustment costs, as in the neoclassical interpretation of Tobin’s Q, cannot substitute for investment planning costs in all of these respects."
Medium Term Business Cycles,EFCE,2003,"Over the postwar, the U.S., Europe and Japan have experienced what may be thought of as medium frequency oscillations between persistent periods of robust growth and persistent periods of relative stagnation. These medium frequency movements, further, appear to bear some relation to the high frequency volatility of output. That is, periods of stagnation are often associated with significant recessions, while persistent booms typically are either free of recessions or are interrupted only by very modest downturns. In this paper we explore the idea of medium term cycles, which we define as reflecting the sum of the high and medium frequency variation in the data. We develop a methodology for identifying these kinds of fluctuations and then show that a number of important macroeconomic time series exhibit significant medium term cycles. The cycles feature strong procyclical movements in both disembodied and embodied technological change, research development, and the efficiency of resource utilization. We then develop a model to explain the medium term cycle that features both disembodied and embodied endogenous technological change, along with countercyclical markups and variable factor utilization. The model is able to generate medium term fluctuations in output, technological change, and resource utilization that resemble the data, with a non-technological shock as the exogenous disturbance. In particular, the model offers a unified approach to explaining both high and medium frequency variation in aggregate business activity."
Optimal Fiscal Policy in a Business Cycle Model without Commitment,EFCE,2003,
"Public Announcements, Adjustment Delays and the Business Cycle",EFCE,2003,"I study the effects of a lack of common knowledge on nominal adjustment in a dynamic price-setting game with incomplete information. In particular, I show how the speed of price adjustments following a nominal or real shock depends on the information structure among price-setters. The provision of public information leads to a reduction of higher-order uncertainty and hence to more rapid price adjustments, but it potentially comes at the cost of an increased exposure to informational noise. I extend my analysis to allow for other disturbances, showing that higher-order uncertainty may account for the persistence of any kind of shock. Finally, I reconsider the role of monetary policy and discuss how the central bank's policy actions may act as a focal point for market beliefs and hence affect nominal and real adjustment through its ""coordination effect""."
Rule-of-Thumb Consumers and the Design of Interest Rate Rules,EFCE,2003,"We introduce rule-of-thumb consumers in an otherwise standard dynamic sticky price model, and show how their presence can change dramatically the properties of widely used interest rate rules. In particular, the existence of a unique equilibrium is no longer guaranteed by an interest rate rule that satisfies the Taylor principle. Thus, when the weight of rule-of-thumb consumers is large, a strong anti-inflationary bias may be needed in order to avoid indeterminacy whenever the central bank follows a rule that responds to contemporaneous inflation and output. On the other hand, when that rule is either forward or backward-looking, the opposite result often holds in a similar environment: only specifications of the rule that violate the Taylor principle (i.e., passive rules) can guarantee a unique equilibrium.

We show that when these entrepreneurs experience persistent idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, the interplay between financing constraints and irreversibility of fixed capital helps to explain several common observations: it explains why inventory investment is very volatile and procyclical, especially during recessions, and it explains why the output and inventories of small firms are more volatile and more cyclical than that of large firms. The model is also consistent with the observations that inventory investment leads the business cycle, and that both fixed and inventory investment are sensitive to the net worth of firms, even when marginal productivity of capital is taken into account."

The model has also a number of implications for firm dynamics supported by empirical evidence, such as a positive correlation between survival, size, and firm age"

Unnatural Selection: Perverse Incentives and the Misallocation of Credit in Japan,EFEL,2003,"This study examines the misallocation of credit in Japan associated with the perverse incentives of banks to provide additional credit to the weakest firms. Firms are far more likely to receive additional credit if they are in poor financial condition, and these firms continue to perform poorly after receiving additional bank financing. Troubled Japanese banks allocate credit to severely impaired borrowers primarily to avoid the realization of losses on their own balance sheets. This problem is compounded by extensive corporate affiliations, which provide a further incentive for banks to allocate scarce credit based on considerations other than prudent credit risk analysis."

A New Micro Model of Exchange Rate Dynamics,IFM,2003,"This paper bridges the microstructure and new macro approaches to exchange rates by addressing how currency markets aggregate information in general equilibrium. Two key features distinguish our model from new macro models: the presence of dispersed information and participation of financial intermediaries who act as market-makers. We depart from microstructure modeling in that real economic activities where dispersed information originates are explicitly identified, as well as the technology by which this information is subsequently aggregated and impounded in price. Financial intermediaries in the model are consolidated with consumers, in the spirit of the ""yeoman farmer"" consolidation of production and consumption in new  macro models. A new forcing variable arises from intermediation that affects both the exchange rate and the currency risk premium (because intermediation involves risks that cannot be fully hedged). The model is structured to permit analysis of order flow, a market-based measure that is much in focus in the empirical literature. In particular, we examine the origins of the positive covariance between exchange rate changes and order flow found in the data. We also identify the specific conditions for using order flow to discriminate transitory from persistent macro shocks. Finally, the model demonstrates why at higher frequencies order flow explains exchange rates better than macro variables, whereas at lower frequencies macro variables predominate."
Analytics of Sovereign Debt Restructuring,IFM,2003,"Over the past few years there has been an active debate on appropriate mechanisms for restructuring sovereign debt, particularly international bonds. This paper develops a simple theoretical model to analyse the merits of these proposals. The analysis suggests that CACs can resolve the inefficiencies caused by intra-creditor coordination problems providing that all parties have complete information about each other’s preferences. In such a world, statutory mechanisms are unnecessary. This is no longer the case, however, when the benefits from reaching a restructuring agreement are private information to the debtor and its creditors. In this case, the inefficiencies induced by strategic behaviour - the debtor-creditor bargaining problem - cannot be resolved by the parties themselves: removing these inefficiencies would require the intervention of a third party."
Asset Prices and Exchange Rates,IFM,2003,"This paper develops a simple two-country, two-good model, in which the real exchange rate, stock and bond prices are jointly determined. The model predicts that stock market prices are correlated internationally even though their dividend processes are independent, providing a theoretical argument in favor of financial contagion. The foreign exchange market serves as a propagation channel from one stock market to the other. The model identifies interconnections between stock, bond and foreign exchange markets and characterizes their joint dynamics as a three-factor model. Contemporaneous responses of each market to changes in the factors are shown to have unambiguous signs. These implications enjoy strong empirical support. Estimation of various versions of the model reveals that most of the signs predicted by the model indeed obtain in the data, and the point estimates are in line with the implications of our theory. Furthermore, the uncovered interest rate parity relationship has a risk premium in our model, shown to be volatile. We also derive agents’ portfolio holdings and identify economic environments under which they exhibit a home bias, and demonstrate that an international CAPM obtaining in our model has two additional factors."
Bonds or Loans? The Effect of Macroeconomic Fundamentals,IFM,2003,"The lending boom of the 1990s witnessed considerable variation over time and across countries in the ratio of international bonds to foreign bank loans used as debt instrument by emerging market borrowers. Why some issuers float international bonds while others borrow from international banks has received little if any systematic attention. This paper tests how macroeconomic fundamentals affect the choice of international debt instrument available to emerging market borrowers. As a stepping stone for empirical analysis, a model with asymmetric information is presented. Empirical results show that macroeconomic fundamentals explain a significant share of variation in the ratio of bonds to loans for private borrowers, but not for the sovereigns."
Empirical Exchange Rate Models of the Nineties: Are Any Fit to Survive?,IFM,2003,"Previous assessments of nominal exchange rate determination have focused upon a narrow set of models typically of the 1970’s vintage. The canonical papers in this literature are by Meese and Rogoff (1983, 1988), who examined monetary and portfolio balance models. Succeeding works by Mark (1995) and Chinn and Meese (1995) focused on similar models. In this paper we re-assess exchange rate prediction using a wider set of models that have been proposed in the last decade: interest rate parity, productivity based models, and ""behavioral equilibrium exchange rate"" models. The performance of these models is compared against a benchmark model – the Dornbusch-Frankel sticky price monetary model. The models are estimated in error correction and first-difference specifications. Rather than estimating the cointegrating vector over the entire sample and treating it as part of the ex ante information set as is commonly done in the literature, we recursively update the cointegrating vector, thereby generating true ex ante forecasts. We examine model performance at various forecast horizons (1 quarter, 4 quarters, 20 quarters) using differing metrics (mean squared error, direction of change), as well as the Aconsistency@ test of Cheung and Chinn (1998). No model consistently outperforms a random walk, by a mean squared error measure; however, along a direction-of-change dimension, certain structural models do outperform a random walk with statistical significance. Moreover, one finds that these forecasts are cointegrated with the actual values of exchange rates, although in a large number of cases, the elasticity of the forecasts with respect to the actual values is different from unity. Overall, model/specification/currency combinations that work well in one period will not necessarily work well in another period."
International Financial Integration,IFM,2003,"In recent decades, foreign assets and liabilities in advanced countries have grown rapidly relative to GDP, with the increase in gross cross-holdings far exceeding the size of net positions. Moreover, the portfolio equity and FDI categories have grown in importance relative to international debt stocks. In this Paper, we describe the broad trends in international financial integration for a sample of industrial countries, and seek to explain the cross-country and  time-series variation in the size of international balance sheets. We also examine the behaviour of the rates of return on foreign assets and liabilities, relating them to ‘market’ returns."
One Cost of Chilean Capital Controls: Increased Financial Constraints for Smaller Traded Firms,IFM,2003,"There is growing support for taxes on short-term capital inflows in emerging markets, such as the encaje adopted by Chile from 1991-98. Previous empirical assessments of the encaje conclude that it may have generated some small economic benefits, such as shifting the composition of capital inflows to a longer maturity, but no significant economic costs. Managers of small and medium-sized companies in Chile, however, claim that the encaje made it substantially more difficult to obtain financing for productive investment. This paper assesses whether the Chilean capital controls increased financial constraints for different-sized, publicly-traded firms. It uses two different testing methodologies: a Tobin's q and Euler-equation framework. Results indicate that during the encaje, smaller traded firms in Chile experienced significant financial constraints and these constraints decreased as firm size increased. Both before and after the encaje, however, no group of traded firms experienced significant financial constraints, and there is no relationship between firm size and financial constraints. Although Chilean-style capital controls may also yield benefits, this cost of the encaje could be particularly important in emerging markets where smaller firms can be valuable sources of job creation and economic growth."
"Promises Made, Promises Broken: A Model of IMF Program Implementation",IFM,2003,"A country that enters an IMF sponsored lending program agrees to enact stabilization and reform measures. The actual disbursal of funds by the Fund is tied through a process known as conditionality to the implementation of these policies. Many programs are not fully completed because the borrowing government fails to comply with the original agreement. This paper presents a model of program implementation, which is then empirically tested with data from the period 1975-99. The IMF and the borrowing country are shown to have asymmetric evaluations of a program’s discounted benefits, due to differences in their measurements of the benefits, the relevant time frame and appropriate discount rate. The model also distinguishes between a government that seeks to maximize national welfare and an autocracy that acts only to benefit the ruling group. It can also be shown that the existence of threshold effects in the benefits may result in dual optimal implementation rates. The results of the empirical analysis demonstrate that successful program implementation is affected by a country’s trade openness, the duration of the political regime, the ideological cohesion of the government, and the degree of political openness."
The High-Frequency Response of Exchange Rates and Interest Rates to Macroeconomic Announcements,IFM,2003,"Many recent papers have studied movements in stock, bond, and currency prices over short windows of time around macro announcements. This paper adds to the announcement affect literature in two ways. First, we study the joint announcement effects across a broad range of assets--exchange rates and U.S. and foreign term structures. In order to evaluate whether the joint effects can be reconciled with conventional theory, we interpret the joint movements in light of uncovered interest rate parity or changes in risk premia. For several real macro announcements, we find that a stronger than expected release appreciates the dollar today, but that it must either (i) lower the relative risk premium for holding foreign currency rather than dollars, or (ii) imply considerable future expected dollar depreciation. The latter implies an overshooting behavior akin to that described by Dornbusch (1976). Second, we use a longer span of data (1987-2002), and more of the data are at high frequency that has been common in announcement work. A longer span of high frequency data contributes to the precision of our estimates and allows us to explore the possibility that the effects of macro surprises on asset prices have varied over time. We find evidence, for example, that PPI releases had a larger effect on U.S. interest rates before about 1992 than subsequently"
Trade Openness And Exchange Rate Misalignments,IFM,2003,"The paper examines the claim that the benefits of real exchange rate flexibility under real foreign shocks and nominal rigidities are smaller for more closed economies. Openness is defined as a country’s steady state exports to GDP ratio, and the benefits of exchange rate flexibility as the welfare difference between fixed and flexible rate outcomes. The paper shows why the benefits of exchange rate flexibility are not systematically related to openness. The main reason is that rigid relative prices cause a contractionary shock to hit demand for all goods equally on impact."
Why Doesn’t Capital Flow from Rich Countries to Poor Countries? An Empirical Investigation,IFM,2003,"We examine the role of the different explanations for the lack of flows of capital from rich countries to poor ones – the Lucas paradox – in an empirical framework. Broadly, the various theoretical explanations for this paradox include differences in fundamentals that affect the production structure versus capital market imperfections. First, we briefly test the predictions of the neoclassical model by performing a calibration exercise using U.S. states, EU and OECD countries. Then, we perform cross-country regressions using a sample of 50 countries. Our empirical evidence shows that for the period 1970-1998 institutional quality is the most important variable explaining the Lucas paradox. We also run regressions with a smaller set of countries for the period 1918-1948. We find that in that earlier period human capital was the determining factor for the lack of flows, as Lucas suggested."
Estimating the Euler Equation for Output,ME,2003,"New Keynesian macroeconomic models have generally emphasized that expectations of future output are a key factor in determining current output. The theoretical motivation for such forward-looking behavior relies on a straightforward generalization of the well-known Euler equation for consumption. In this paper, we use maximum likelihood and generalized method of moments (GMM) methods to explore the empirical importance of output expectations. We find little evidence that rational expectations of future output help determine current output, especially after taking into account the small-sample bias in GMM."
Monetary Policy in Inattentive Economies,ME,2003,
The Case for Open-Market Purchases in a Liquidity Trap,ME,2003,"Prevalent thinking about liquidity traps suggests that the perfect substitutability of money and bonds at a zero short-term nominal interest rate renders open-market operations ineffective for achieving macroeconomic stabilization goals. We show that even were this the case, there remains a powerful argument for large-scale open market operations as a fiscal policy tool. As we also demonstrate, however, this same reasoning implies that open-market operations will be beneficial for stabilization as well, even when the economy is expected to remain mired in a liquidity trap for some time. Thus, the microeconomic fiscal benefits of open-market operations in a liquidity trap go hand in hand with standard macroeconomic objectives. Motivated by Japan’s recent economic experience, we use a dynamic general-equilibrium model to assess the welfare impact of open-market operations for an economy in Japan’s predicament. We argue Japan can achieve a substantial welfare improvement through large open-market purchases of domestic government debt."
The Excess Sensitivity of Long-Term Interest Rates: Evidence and Implications for Macroeconomic Models,ME,2003,"This paper demonstrates that long-term forward interest rates in the U.S. often react considerably to surprises in macroeconomic data releases and monetary policy announcements. This behavior is in contrast to the prediction of many macroeconomic models, in which the long-run properties of the economy are assumed to be time-invariant and perfectly known by all economic agents: Under those assumptions, the shocks we consider would have only transitory effects on short-term interest rates, and hence would not generate large responses in forward rates. Our empirical findings suggest that private agents adjust their expectations of the long-run inflation rate in response to macroeconomic and monetary policy surprises. We present an alternative model that captures this behavior. Consistent with our hypothesis, forward rates derived from inflation-indexed Treasury debt show little sensitivity to these shocks, indicating that the response of nominal forward rates is mostly driven by inflation compensation. In addition, we find that in the U.K., where the long-run inflation target is known by the private sector, long-term forward rates have not demonstrated excess sensitivity since the Bank of England achieved independence in mid-1997."
"The Real Thing: Nominal Price Rigidity of the Nickel Coke, 1886-1959",ME,2003,"We study price rigidity of Coca-Cola during the 1886–1959 period. The price of a 6 1⁄2 oz Coke was 5ffi starting on May 29, 1886, the day it was first introduced to the public at Jacob’s Pharmacy at 2 Peachtree Street in Atlanta, until about 1959. Thus we are documenting a nominal price rigidity that lasted more than 70 years! This is remarkable, and to our knowledge, no study has documented such persistent price rigidity. The case of Coca-Cola is particularly interesting because during the 70-year period there were substantial changes in the structure of the soft drink market, two World Wars and the Great Depression along with less remarkable economic fluctuations as well as numerous regulatory interventions, which led to substantial changes in the demand and supply conditions. Yet the actual price to customers did not reflect these changes, as traditional economic theory would predict: the company insisted that the price of Coke be held at 5¢. To explain this unusual puzzle, we use information provided by the Coca-Cola Company Archives and the Robert W. Woodruff Collection at Emory University. We combine this information with data collected from beverage industry trade publications and the Historical Statistics of the U.S. to provide some direct and indirect evidence on the actual quantitative magnitude of price, quality, and quantity adjustment costs for Coca-Cola. In addition, we demonstrate that the incredibly long period of the Coca-Cola price rigidity was accompanied by equally long-lasting Coca-Cola quality rigidity. These rigidities, we argue, can be best explained by the presence of long-term relationship and implicit contract of a rather explicit form between the Coca-Cola Company and the American public. Moreover, we demonstrate that the company systematically chose the option of quantity adjustment over price or quality adjustment. This, despite the fact that the cost of quantity adjustment was substantial. The implication is that, the perceived price and quality adjustment costs in this particular setting were far larger than the quantity adjustment cost. Placing a unique twist on the story, we also suggest three new explanations, two technology-based, and one based on a simple model of monopoly under stages of processing that likely played a role in the Coca-Cola price rigidity. We assess the existing theories of price rigidity by examining their empirical relevance for the case of Coca-Cola. We find that of the twelve theories we consider, nine of them can be ruled out as being inconsistent with the 70-year long price rigidity. A broadly defined cost of price adjustment notion is used to highlight common features of the theories we rule in. We demonstrate that the nickel coke was not really an exception in terms of the nature of its price rigidity, although it probably breaks any modern time record in terms of the longevity of the rigidity. We provide detailed historical evidence on the prevalence of widely used “customary, fixed prices” in the US as well as in Europe, and find that a non-trivial proportion of the retail trade was conducted at 5 and 10 cents for perhaps as long as 40 years. Finally, we argue that this study can be viewed not only as a study of unusually long price rigidity, but also as a study of a non-price market-clearing mechanism. In this particular case, we find that the adjustment was taking place through quantity."
The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,ME,2003,-
Tracking the Source of the Decline in GDP Volatility: An Analysis of the Automobile Industry,ME,2003,"Recent work by Kahn, McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2002) has argued that improvements in information technology and inventory management are the chief source of the decline in output volatility since 1984. A key piece of evidence in support of their argument is the decline in the variance of production relative to the variance of sales. This paper investigates the alternative hypothesis that declines in production volatility relative to sales stem from changes in the nature of the sales process rather than from changes in the structure of production and inventories. In particular, a small decrease in the volatility of sales can lead to a large decrease in the volatility of production if there are nonconvexities in the cost function. We confirm this intuition using simulations based on the cost function of automobile assembly plants. We then conduct an analysis of changes in production scheduling across U.S. automobile plants from the 1970s to the 1990s with a new plant-level dataset."
Uncertainty and Company Investment: An Empirical Investigation Using Data on Analysts' Profit Forecasts,ME,2003,"We investigate the empirical relationship between company investment and measures of uncertainty, controlling for the effect of expected future profitability on current investment decisions. We consider three measures of uncertainty, based on: (i) volatility in the firm’s daily stock returns; (ii) disagreement between different securities analysts in their forecasts of the firm’s future profits; and (iii) the variance of forecast errors in analysts’ forecasts of the firm’s future profits. We consider two controls for expected profitability: (i) a standard measure of Tobin’s q constructed from the firm’s stock market valuation; and (ii) an alternative measure of the q ratio constructed from discounted forecasts of the firm’s future profits stream. Empirical results are presented for a sample of 946 publicly traded US companies that were tracked by two or more securities analysts for at least four consecutive years between 1982 and 1999. All three measures of uncertainty are found to be positively correlated with each other. When we consider these measures individually, in each case we find a significantly negative long run effect of higher uncertainty on capital accumulation, which is robust to the inclusion of either of our controls for expected profitability. When we consider these measures jointly, we find that the level of disagreement between analysts provides the most informative indicator for identifying this long run effect of uncertainty on capital accumulation. In addition we find a significantly negative short run interaction term between share price volatility and current sales growth, consistent with the idea that, at higher levels of uncertainty, investment will respond less to a given demand shock. These effects of uncertainty on investment are shown to be quantitatively as well as statistically significant."
What Explains the Stock Markets Reaction to Federal Reserve Policy?,ME,2003,"This paper analyzes the impact of unanticipated changes in the Federal funds target on equity prices, with the aim of both estimating the size of the typical reaction, and understanding the reasons for the market’s response. On average over the June 1989 to December 2002 sample, a typical unanticipated 25 basis point rate cut is associated with a roughly 1 percent increase in the level of stock prices, as measured by the S&P  500 composite or the CRSP value-weighted index. There is some evidence of a weaker response to unexpected decisions to keep the funds rate unchanged, and a stronger response to reversals in the direction of rate changes. The estimated response also varies widely across industries, with the greatest sensitivity observed in high tech and telecommunications, and the smallest in energy and utilities. Very little of the market’s reaction can be attributed to policy’s effects on the real rate of interest. The majority of the response of the current excess return on equities can be traced to policy’s impact on expected future excess returns, with some effect also coming through expected future dividends."

A Unified Framework for Measuring Preferences for Schools and Neighborhoods (and data details),PERE,2003,"Estimating the demand for non-marketed goods such as school quality poses challenging endogeneity and selection problems. To address these, this paper develops a comprehensive new approach for recovering the full distribution of preferences for school and neighborhood attributes from observed household choices. The framework has three key features: it recovers structural preference parameters, allowing for a gread deal of preference heterogeneity; it deals with the non-random sorting of households across neighborhoods by modeling the sorting process directly, in a manner consistent with equilibrium cosiderations; and it allows this sorting to be influenced by unobservable choice characteristics, while overcoming significant endogeneity problems using a boundary fixed effects approach. We estimate the model using rich data on a large metropolitan area, drawn from a restricted version of the Census. The new estimates, the most reliable yet to appear in the literature, indicate that on average households are willing to pay an additional one percent in house prices when the average performance of the local school is increased by 5 percent, and also that there is considerable preference heterogeneity. Using our equilibrium framework to explore the general equlibrium implications of these new estimates, we show that the estimated heterogeneity gives rise to substantial variation in the capitalization of school quality in housing prices throughout the metropolitan region. Further, the full capitalization of school quality into housing prices is typically 70-75 percent greater than the direct effect, as the result of a social multiplier. Focusing on the direct effect only, the prior literature has neglected this significant general equilibrium mechanism, whereby increases in school quality also raise housing prices by attracting households with more education and income to the corresponding neighborhood."
Are Underserved Borrowers Lower Risk? New Evidence on the Performance and Pricing of FHA-Insured Morgages,PERE,2003,
Bidding for Industrial Plants: Does Winning a 'Million Dollar Plant' Increase Welfare?,PERE,2003,"Increasingly, local governments compete by offering substantial subsidies to industrial plants to locate within their jurisdictions. This paper uses a novel research design to examine the consequences of successfully bidding for a plant on country-level labor earnings, property values, and public finances. Each issue of the corporate real estate journal Site Selection includes an article titled ""The Million Dollar Plant"" that describes how a large plant decided where to locate. These articles report the county where the plant chose to locate (i.e., the 'winner'), as well as the one or two runner-up counties (i.e., the 'losers'). The losers are counties that have survived a long selection process, but narrowly lost the competition. We use these revealed rankings of profit-maximizing firms to form a counterfactual for what would have happened in the winner counties in the absence of the plant opening. We find that a plant opening is associated with a  1.5% trend break in labor earnings in the new plant's industry in winning counties (relative to losing ones) after the opening of the plant (relative period before the opening). Property values may provide a summary measure of the net change in welfare, because the costs and benefits of attracting a plant should be capitalized into the price of land. We find a positive, relative trend break of 1.1% in property values. Further, we fail to find any deterioration in local governments' financial position. Overall, the results undermine the popular view that the provision of local subsidies to attract large industrial plants reduces local residents' welfare"
Maintenance and the Home Equity of the Elderly,PERE,2003,"The empirically observed failure of older households to reduce home equity has long puzzled economists. The magnitude of home equity reduction is understated if self-reported home values of the elderly do not incorporate the market’s view of the state of repair. Panel analysis of the American Housing Survey shows that households over age 75 spend approximately $270 less per year on routine home maintenance than younger households and approximately $1,100 less in total expenditures, including repairs, alteration and replacements. The homes of older households are significantly more likely to fall into disrepair between waves of the AHS. When older households sell their homes, the new owners consider the home to be less nice than the older occupants did, a phenomenon which occurs to a much smaller extent when the seller is younger. Homes sold by older households exhibit weaker price appreciation than those owned by younger households, but this result depends on whether the base price is the purchase price or the estimated value at the start of the panel. Based on purchase-price to purchase price differences, a year of occupancy by an older household is associated with a 1.5 percent reduction in resale value."
"The Urban Rat Race: Thick Markets, Signaling, and Hours Worked in Big Cities",PERE,2003,"This paper establishes the existence of the previously overlooked relationship between agglomeration and hours worked. Using 1990 IPUMS data on full-time workers, the paper shows that professionals work longer hours when there is a high density of other workers in the same occupation. This effect is twice as a large for the young as for the middle-aged. Young professional work hours are also shown to be especially sensitive to the presence of labor market rivals. No such relationship is found for the middle-aged. This pattern has a number of potential explanations, including the selection of hard workers into cities and the high productivity of agglomerated labor. The pattern can also be explained by the keen rivalry associated with large markets, a kind of urban rat race. Using differencing methods, the paper finds evidence of all three forces among professional workers. In contrast for non-professionals, work-spreading effects appear to dominate for all age groups."
Why is Manhattan So Expensive? Regulation and the Rise of House Prices,PERE,2003,"Home building is a highly competitive industry with almost no natural barriers to entry. If home prices are significantly more expensive than the marginal cost of home production, then there must be barriers to new construction. We use the markups of home prices over production costs to estimate the impact of regulatory restrictions on housing prices. Our results suggest that barriers to construction represent a large component of housing prices in a number of primarily coastal markets. We also conduct a detailed study of Manhattan because marginal production costs can be more cleanly measured there, as the marginal cost of an extra apartment is the cost of making a new project a little bit taller. The cost of building apartments in Manhattan currently is no more than 50 percent of sales price, so that one-half of the cost of a Manhattan apartment should be understood as the result of barriers to new construction. We close the paper with a welfare analysis that suggests increased building activity in Manhattan will almost surely increase total social surplus, with the current gap between market values and construction costs being roughly three times larger than our estimates of the negative externalities generated by new development."
A New Micro Model of Exchange Rate Dynamics,AP,2004,"We address the exchange rate determination puzzle by examining how information is aggregated in a dynamic general equilibrium (DGE) setting. Unlike other DGE macro models, which enrich either preference structures or production structures, our model enriches the information structure. The model departs from microstructure-style modeling by identifying the real activities where dispersed information originates, as well as the technology by which information is subsequently aggregated and impounded. Results relevant to the determination puzzle include: (1) persistent gaps between exchange rates and macro fundamentals, (2) excess volatility relative to macro fundamentals, (3) exchange rate movements without macro news, (4) little or no exchange rate movement when macro news occurs, and (5) a structural-economic rationale for why transcation flows perform well in accounting for monthly exchange rate changes, whereas macro variables perform poorly. Though past micro analysis has made progress on results (1) through (3), results (4) and (5) are new. Excess volatility arises in our model for a new reason: rational exchange rate errors feed back into the fundamentals that the xchange rate is trying to track. "

Financial Claustrophobia: Asset Pricing in Illiquid Markets,AP,2004,
International Financial Adjustment,AP,2004,"The paper proposes a unified framework to understand the dynamics of net foreign assets and exchange rate movements. Focusing on the financial account and its determinants, we show that countries' capital gains and losses on net foreign assets constitute an important channel for external adjustment. For example, a depreciation of the domestic currency or a drop in the domestic stock market index improves the sustainability of a country's external position by decreasing the value of its liabilities to foreigners. Our theory implies that deviations from trend of the ratio of net exports to net foreign assets contain information about future portfolio returns and, possibly, future exchange rate changes. Using quarterly data on U.S. gross foreign positions and returns, we find that adjustments in the country's external position occur indeed mostly at short to medium horizons through portfolio revaluations, not through future changes in net exports. At longer horizons, adjustment occurs through changes in net exports. We also find evidence of predictability of net foreign asset portfolio returns at horizons between one quarter to two years and on exchange rates at one quarter and beyond. A one standard deviation of the ratio of net exports to net foreign assets predicts an (annualized) 4% depreciation of the exchange rate over the next quarter. These results cast a new light on the sustainability of US current account deficits."
Measuring Default Risk Premia from Default Swap Rates and EDFs,AP,2004,"This paper estimates recent default risk premia for U.S. corporate debt, based on a close relationship between default probabilities, as estimated by Moody’s KMV EDFs, and default swap (CDS) market rates. The default-swap data, obtained through CIBC from 22 banks and specialty dealers, allow us to establish a strong link between actual and risk-neutral default probabilities for the 69 firms in the three sectors that we analyze: broadcasting and entertainment, healthcare, and oil and gas. We find dramatic variation over time in risk premia, from peaks in the third quarter of 2002, dropping by roughly 50% to late 2003."
Portfolio Choice and Location of Trade,AP,2004,"This paper studies the portfolio choices of individual investors. We test the predictions of a multi-asset rational expectations model in an intra-national setting. We partition investors along geographic dimensions (provinces) and other dimensions (industries, languages, cultural groups.) These partitions exploit unique features of an emerging stock market that allow us to decompose holdings in ways that have previously not been possible. Surprisingly, stocks that are traded near where investors live receive the highest weights in their portfolios. This finding gives insight into an existing puzzle in finance regarding location of trade. Finally, we test whether portfolio choices are the result of information asymmetries or familiarity. We find no evidence that individual investors possess valuable information. Three separate tests support the idea that simple familiarity drives purchases."
Stock and Bond Returns with Moody Investors,AP,2004,"We present a tractable, linear model for the simultaneous pricing of stock and bond returns that incorporates stochastic risk aversion. In this model, analytic solutions for endogenous stock and bond prices and returns are readily calculated. After estimating the parameters of the model by GMM, we investigate a series of classic puzzles of the empirical asset pricing literature. In particular, our model is shown to jointly accommodate the mean and volatility of equity and long term bond risk premia as well as salient features of the nominal short rate, the dividend yield, and the term spread. Also, the model matches the evidence for predictability of excess stock and bond returns. However, the stock-bond return correlation implied by the model is somewhat higher than in the data."
Why is Long-horizon Equity Less Risky? A Duration Based Explanation of the Value Premium,AP,2004,"This paper proposes a dynamic risk-based model that captures the high expected returns on value stocks relative to growth stocks, and the failure of the capital asset pricing model to explain these expected returns. To model the difference between value and growth stocks, we introduce a cross-section of long-lived firms distinguished by the timing of their cash flows. Firms with cash flows weighted more to the future have high price ratios, while firms with cash flows weighted more to the present have low price ratios. We model how investors perceive the risks of these cash flows by specifying a stochastic discount factor for the economy. The stochastic discount factor implies that shocks to aggregate dividends are priced, but that shocks to the time-varying price of risk are not. As long-horizon equity, growth stocks covary more with this time-varying price of risk than value stocks, which covary more with shocks to cash flows. When the model is calibrated to explain aggregate stock market behavior, we find that it can also account for much of the observed value premium, the high Sharpe ratios on value stocks relative to growth stocks, and the outperformance of value (and underperformance of growth) relative to the CAPM."
Agreeing Now to Agree Later: Contracts that Rule Out but do not Rule In,CF,2004,"We view a contract as a list of outcomes. Ex ante, the parties commit not to consider outcomes not on the list, i.e., these are “ruled out”. Ex post, they freely bargain over outcomes on the list, i.e., the contract specifies no mechanism to structure their choice; in this sense outcomes on the list are not “ruled in”. A “loose” contract (long list) maximizes flexibility but may interfere with ex ante investment incentives. When these incentives are important enough, the parties may write a “tight” contract (short list), even though this leads to ex post inefficiency."
Are Perks Purely Managerial Excess?,CF,2004,"Why do some firms tend to offer executives a variety of perks while others offer none at all? A widespread view in the corporate finance literature is that executive perks are a form of agency or private benefit and a way for managers to misappropriate some of the surplus the firm generates. According to this view, firms with plenty of free cash flow that operate in industries with limited investment prospects should typically offer perks. The theory also suggests that firms that are subject to more external monitoring should have fewer perks. Overall, the evidence for the private benefits explanation is, at best, mixed. We do, however, find evidence that perks are offered most in situations where they are likely to enhance managerial productivity. This suggests that a view of perks that sees them purely as managerial excess is incorrect."
Cultural Biases in Economic Exchange,CF,2004,
Distance Constraints: The Limits of Foreign Lending In Poor Economies,CF,2004,"As foreign banks expand into emerging markets, do they face extra informational and agency constraints due to greater distance between the CEO and her loan officers? Using a new quarterly panel data set of 80,000 loans over 7 years, I show that greater cultural and geographical distance leads foreign banks to further avoid lending to “informationally difficult” yet fundamentally sound firms requiring relational contracting. Greater distance also makes them less likely to bilaterally renegotiate, and less successful at recovering defaults. Differences in bank size, legal institutions, or unobserved borrower heterogeneity cannot explain these results. The distance constraints identified in this paper can be economically large enough to permanently exclude certain sectors of the economy from financing by foreign banks."
Financial Constraints and Growth: Multinational and Local Firm Responses to Currency Crises,CF,2004,"This paper studies the effects of financial constraints on firm growth by investigating if large depreciations differentially impact multinational affiliates and local firms in emerging markets. U.S. multinational affiliates increase sales, assets and investment significantly more than local firms during, and subsequent to, currency crises. The enhanced relative performance of multinationals is traced to their ability to use internal capital markets to capitalize on the competitiveness benefits of large depreciations. Investment specifications indicate that increases in leverage resulting from sharp depreciations constrain local firms from capitalizing on these investment opportunities, but do not constrain multinational affiliates. Multinational parents also infuse new capital in their affiliates after currency crises. These results indicate another role for foreign direct investment in emerging markets—multinational affiliates expand economic activity during currency crises when local firms are most constrained."
"How Do Family Ownership, Control, and Management Affect Firm Value?",CF,2004,"Using proxy data on all Fortune 500 firms during 1994-2000, we find that family ownership creates value only when the founder serves as the CEO of the family firm or as its Chairman with a hired CEO. Dual share classes, pyramids, and voting agreements reduce the founder’s premium. When descendants serve as CEOs, firm value is destroyed. Our findings suggest that the classic owner-manager conflict in non-family firms is more costly than the conflict between family and non-family shareholders in founder-CEO firms. However, the conflict between family and non-family shareholders in descendant-CEO firms is more costly than the owner-manager conflict in non-family firms."
Matching Bankruptcy Laws to Legal Environments,CF,2004,"We study a model of optimal bankruptcy law in an environment where legal quality can vary along two dimensions: the quality of contract enforcement, and the ability of judges. We show that a judicially-influenced bankruptcy process can enhance the efficiency of incomplete contracts by conditioning the liquidation/reorganization decision on ex-post information about firm quality. We consider the optimal balance of debtor and creditor interests as a function of the legal environment, and show that the optimal degree of ""creditor-friendliness"" in the bankruptcy law increases as the quality of enforcement of contracts deteriorates and as judicial ability to recognize firm quality falls. We also explore the optimal scope of bankruptcy law and find that it may be optimal to ""target"" the law to a smaller subset of firms for which judicial discretion is most valuable, particularly when judges are less experienced. Our model contributes to the existing law and finance literature in demonstrating that optimal bankruptcy laws, in particular the degree of optimal creditor protection, depends heavily on the existing legal environment. The model also explains some cross-sectional patterns in bankruptcy laws adopted around the world."
Organizational Scope and Investment: Evidence from the Drug Development Strategies of Biopharmaceutical Firms,CF,2004,"This paper compares the clinical trial strategies and performance of large, established (“mature”) biopharmaceutical firms to those of smaller (“early stage”) firms that have not yet successfully developed a drug. We study a sample of 235 cancer drug candidates that entered clinical trials during the period 1990-2002 and were sponsored by public firms. We find that early stage firms are more likely than mature firms to advance from Phase I clinical trials to Phase II, but that the clinical results of their Phase II trials are less promising. Early stage firms are also less likely to advance to Phase III. This pattern is more pronounced for early stage firms with large cash reserves. The evidence points to an agency problem between shareholders and managers of single-product early stage firms who, we argue, are reluctant to abandon development of their only viable drug candidates. By contrast, the managers of mature firms are more willing to drop unpromising drug candidates because they have other ones they can easily bring to clinical trials. The findings appear to be consistent with the benefits of internal capital markets identified by Stein (1997)."
Ownership: Evolution and Regulation,CF,2004,"This paper is the first study of long-run evolution of investor protection, equity financing and corporate ownership in the U.K. over the 20th century. Formal regulation only emerged in the second half of the century. We assess its influence on finance and ownership by comparing evolution of firms incorporating at different stages of the century. Regulation had little impact on equity issues or dispersion of ownership: even in the absence of regulation, there was a large amount of both, primarily associated with mergers. The main effect of regulation was on share trading and the market for corporate control. These results cast doubt on law and finance theories and suggest financial development in the U.K. relied more on informal relations of trust than on formal systems of regulation."
Portfolio Choice and Corporate Financial Policy When There Are Tax-Intermediating Dealers,CF,2004,"Miller (1977) emphasized that optimal corporate financial policy depends on the tax rates facing the firm as well as the tax treatment accorded bond- and stock-holders. In equilibrium, firms will issue claims that are held by the full spectrum of investors, from tax-exempt institutional investors to heavily taxed individuals. However, dealers are tax neutral institutions that can buy corporate securities and, under some circumstances, reissue them as a financial package with different tax characteristics. This activity potentially severs the link between the securities the firm issues and the securities investors hold. In a continuous-time setting with dealers, I show that investors generally will hold derivatives, and possibly stock, in lieu of holding taxable bonds. Moreover, the marginal tax advantage to debt in this setting is the corporate tax rate."
The Costs of Bankruptcy: Chapter 7 Cash Auctions vs. Chapter 11 Bargaining,CF,2004,"Our paper explores a comprehensive sample of both small and large corporate bankruptcies in Arizona and New York from 1995–2001. We find that bankruptcy costs are very heterogeneous and sensitive to measurement method. Still, Chapter 7 liquidations seem more expensive in direct and equally expensive in indirect costs, than Chapter 11 bankruptcies. The paper provides a large number of further empirical regularities."
The Market for Mergers and the Boundaries of the Firm,CF,2004,"Mergers are the mechanisms that redraw the boundaries of the firm. In this paper, we relate incomplete contracts, upon which much of our understanding of firm boundaries is based, to empirical regularities in the market for mergers and acquisitions. We begin by empirically challenging conventional wisdom about mergers and acquisitions: high M/B acquirers typically do not purchase low M/B targets. Instead, mergers typically pair together firms with similar M/B ratios. To show why this occurs, we build a continuous time model of investment and merger activity that combines search, relative scarcity, and asset complementarity. Our model shows that the ‘like buys like’ empirical finding is a natural consequence of a prediction from the property rights theory of the firm; namely, that complementary assets should be placed under common control. A number of new empirical predictions emerge from our analysis. First, if asset complementarity is important, then we should see small differences in the M/B of targets and acquirers. It also predicts that the difference in M/B ratios should increase when discount rates are high and valuations are low. In additional tests, we show that both of these predictions are borne out by the data. Our findings suggest that the incomplete contracts theory of the firm is central to understanding the empirical regularities of the market for mergers and acquisitions."
The Politics of Bank Failures: Evidence from Emerging Markets,CF,2004,"This paper studies large private banks in 21 major emerging markets in the 1990s. It first demonstrates that bank failures are very common in these countries: About 25% of these banks failed during the seven-year sample period. The paper also shows that political concerns play a significant role in delaying government interventions to failing banks. Failing banks are much less likely to be taken over by the government or to lose their licenses before elections than after. This result is robust to controlling for macroeconomic and bank-specific factors, a new party in power, outstanding loans from IMF, as well as country-specific, time-independent factors. This finding implies that much of the within-country clustering in emerging market bank failures is directly due to political concerns."

Identifying the Influences of Real and Nominal Rigidities in Aggregate Price Setting Behavior,EFCE,2004,"We formulate a generalized price-setting framework that incorporates staggered contracts of multiple durations and that enables us to directly identify the influences of nominal vs. real rigidities. Using German macroeconomic data over the period 1975Q1 through 1998Q4 to estimate this framework, we find that the data is well-characterized by a truncated Calvo-style distribution with an average duration of about two quarters. We also find that new contracts exhibit very low sensitivity to marginal cost, corresponding to a relatively high degree of real rigidity. Finally, our results indicate that backward-looking behavior is not needed to explain the aggregate data, at least in an environment with a stable monetary policy regime and a transparent and credible inflation objective."
Inflation and Welfare in Models with Trading Frictions,EFCE,2004,"We study the effects of inflation in models with various trading frictions. The framework is related to recent search-based monetary theory, in that trade takes place periodically in centralized and decentralized markets, but we consider three alternative mechanisms for price formation: bargaining, price taking, and posting. Both the value of money per transaction and market composition are endogenous, allowing us to characterize intensive and extensive margin effects. In the calibrated model, under posting the cost of inflation is similar to previous estimates, around 1% of consumption. Under bargaining, it is considerably bigger, between 3% and 5%. Under price taking, the cost of inflation depends on parameters, but tends to be between the bargaining and posting models. In some cases, moderate inflation may increase output or welfare."

Price Rigidity in German Manufacturing,EFCE,2004,"Price setting in German manufacturing is analysed using a monthly panel of individual price data for more than 2 500 products groups that covers the period from 1980 to 2001. The mean duration of price spells turns out to be shorter for intermediate goods (2 quarters) than for investment goods (3 quarters) and consumer goods (3-4 quarters). The pattern of price increases and price decreases varies across industries. Regarding investment goods there is a clear asymmetry between price increases and price decreases. For investment goods an atheoretical Cox-duration model is estimated. Price increases can be explained by a combination of state-dependence and time-dependence. Time-dependence comes in by seasonal effects and by a bathtube shaped duration dependence that is independent of other factors. Whereas a price increase comes unexpected to firms in less than 20 percent, price reductions are unexpected in more than 40 percent of all cases. Prices of investment goods react stronger to demand decreases than to demand increases. Demand expectations can partly be explained by backward-looking behaviour."

"Productivity, Employment, and Inventories: Smoothing Over Sticky Prices",EFCE,2004,"Whether or not inventories can be used to break the link between production and sales is crucial for understanding firms’ employment response to productivity shocks in sticky-price models. In a Taylor-type sticky-price model with inventories, we show that the employment response to a productivity shock depends on the extent to which goods are storable. Whereas in conventional sticky-price models without inventories, productivity shocks reduce employment, the same shocks cause firms in our economy to expand output relative to sales, build up inventories and, as a result, hire more workers. We then estimate the employment response to productivity shocks in disaggregated U.S. manufacturing data from 1958 to 1996. Consistent with our theory, we find that an industry’s employment response to productivity shifts is strongly correlated with its inventory holdings and the storability of its products."
Real Effects of Inflation through the Redistribution of Wealth: A Reassessment,EFCE,2004,"This paper analyzes the effects of inflation through changes in the value of nominal assets. Nominal positions in the U.S. economy are documented for different sectors as well as age and wealth groups of households. The redistribution brought about by a moderate inflation episode is estimated and a calibrated OLG model is used to assess the long-term response of the economy under alternative fical policy rules. Redistribution takes the form of “ends-against-the-middle:” the middle class gains at the cost of the rich and poor. In addition, inflation favors the young over the old. The amount of redistribution is sizeable, and highly persistent real effects arise both at the individual and at the aggregate level."

The Pricing Behaviour of Italian Firms: New Survey Evidence on Price Stickiness,EFCE,2004,"This study examines price setting behaviour of Italian firms on the basis of the results of a survey conducted by Banca d’Italia in early 2003 on a sample of around 350 firms belonging to all economic sectors. Prices are mostly fixed following standard mark-up rules, although customer-specific characteristics have a role, in particular in manufacturing and services where price discrimination across customers matters. Rival prices mostly affect price-setting strategies in industrial firms. In reviewing their prices, firms follow either state-dependent rules or a combination of time and state-dependent ones. Concerning the frequency of price adjustments, a considerable degree of stickiness emerges both at the stage in which firms evaluate their pricing strategies and the stage in which they actually implement the price change. In 2002 most firms changed their price only once. Three alternative explanations of nominal rigidity are ranked highest by the firms interviewed: explicit contracts, tacit collusive behaviour and the perception of the temporary nature of the shock. Prices respond asymmetrically to shocks, depending on the direction of the adjustment (positive vs negative) and the source of the shock (demand vs supply). Real rigidities – captured by the degree of market competition, customers’ search costs, the sensitivity of profits to changes in demand – play an important role in determining this asymmetry. Moreover, whereas cost shocks impact more when prices have to be raised than when they have to be reduced, demand decreases are more likely to induce a price change than demand increases."
Asset Pricing Implications of Pareto Optimality with Private Information,EFEL,2004,"In this paper, we consider a dynamic economy in which the agents in the economy are privately informed about their skills, which evolve stochastically over time in an arbitrary fashion. We consider an asset pricing equilibrium in which equilibrium qunatities are constrained Pareto optimal. Under the assumption that agents have constant relative risk aversion, we derive a a novel asset pricing kernel for financial asset returns. The kernel equals the reciprocal of the gross growth of the γth moment of the consumption distritbution, where γ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. This implication can be evaluated using a time series of cross sections. We use data from the consumer expenditure survey (CEX) and show that the new stochastic discount factor performs better than existing stochastic discount factors at rationalizing the equity premium. However, its ability to simultaneously explain the equity premium and the expected return to the Treasury bill is about the same as existing discounting factors."
Asset Pricing with Limited Risk Sharing and Heterogeneous Agents,EFEL,2004,
Bank Credit Cycles,EFEL,2004,"Banks produce private information about prospective borrowers. But, in the lending market banks compete with each other without knowing how much information is being produced by rival lenders. We show that strategic interaction between banks results in endogenous credit cycles, with periodic ""credit crunches."" Banks can create winner’s curse problems for rivals by adjusting their credit standards (amount of information produced), sometimes raising standards resulting in some borrowers being unable to obtain credit (a ""credit crunch""). This can occur without any change in the macroeconomic environment. We then provide a variety of empirical evidence that this strategic interaction is an important part of business cycle dynamics and is a priced factor in bank stock returns."
"Buried by Aggregation: Excavating the Dynamics of Investment, Employment, and Uncertainty",EFEL,2004,"Micro evidence on investment and employment has uncovered stark evidence of lumpy intermittent behaviour. This is consistent with non-convex adjustment cost models in which uncertainty plays a central role in driving firm behaviour. This lumpy micro-behaviour, however, is buried by cross-sectional and time series aggregation at the firm level, obscuring any underlying structural model. To excavate beneath this aggregation we construct a model with capital, labour, and time varying uncertainty, which we explicitly aggregate to yearly firm values and structurally estimate against Compustat using indirect inference. This model then provides a laboratory to examine the impact of policy changes and shocks on investment and employment. Three experiments are considered: (i) temporarily raising uncertainty as in OPEC I and II, and 9/11/2001; (ii) permanently increasing labour adjustment costs from US to EU levels; and (iii) cutting capital taxes by 1%."
Diversification and Capital Gains Taxes with Multiple Risky Assets,EFEL,2004,"We examine the impact of capital gains taxes upon the structure of an investor's optimal portfolio in the presence of multiple risky assets. Our numerical solutions suggest that the diversification benefits of reducing the exposure to a highly volatile concentrated position significantly outweigh the tax costs of selling, even for elderly investors. The presence of multiple risky assets in which the investor earns a substantial risk premium strongly increases the diversification incentive. We also contrast the impact of capital gains taxes and traditional transcation costs on rebalancing decisions and show that it can be optimal for the investor to reduce his overall equity exposure by selling underweighted assets with relatively small capital gains. Finally, we discuss the general qualitative features of the optimal investment policy in a broader context. Both our numerical and qualitative analyses show how the realization decision on one asset depends upon the embedded gains on other assets."
Does Monetary Policy Help Least Those Who Need It the Most?,EFEL,2004,"We estimate the effects of U.S. monetary policy on the cross-sectional distribution of state economic activity variables for a 35-year panel. Our results indicate that the effects of policy have a significant history dependence, in that depressed regions contract more to contractionary monetary shocks. Moreover, policy is asymmetric, in that expansionary shocks have less of a beneficial impact upon depressed areas. As a result, we conclude that slower growing regions benefit relatively less from monetary expansions and decline relatively more following monetary contractions."
Financial Markets and Wages,EFEL,2004,"We study the optimal long-term wage contract between firms and workers in the presence of financial constraints. Firms that are financially constrained promise an increasing wage profile, that is, they pay lower wages today in exchange of higher future wages once they become unconstrained and operate at a larger scale. In equilibrium, constrained firms are on average smaller and pay lower wages. In this way the model generates a positive relation between firm size and wages. The model also captures other empirical regularities such as the lower wages paid by fast growing firms."
Fiscal Policy and Financial Depth,EFEL,2004,"Most economists and observers place the lack of fiscal discipline at the core of the recent Argentine crisis. This begs the question of how countries like Belgium or Italy (pre-Maastricht) could run large fiscal deficits and accumulate debts far beyond those of Argentina, without experiencing crises nearly as dramatic as that of Argentina? Why is it that Argentina cannot act like Belgium or Italy and pursue expansionary fiscal policy during downturns? We argue that advanced and emerging economies differ in their financial depth, and show that lack of financial depth constrains fiscal policy in a way that can overturn standard Keynesian fiscal policy prescriptions. We also provide empirical support for this viewpoint. Crowding out is systematically larger in emerging markets than in developed economies. More importantly, this difference is extreme during crises, when the crowding out coefficient exceeds one in emerging market economies."

The Distribution of Gains from Access to Stocks,EFEL,2004,"Recent market developments raise doubts regarding further spread of household stock market participation. We study, computationally and econometrically, net gains from access to stocks, and estimate the potentially changing role of their determinants across the distribution of such gains for US households. We highlight conflicting influences on net gains using a computational portfolio  model, and use empirical estimates to derive differences in characteristics of potential entrants relative to marginal investors by the end of the dramatic recent expansion in the stockholder base. Findings suggest that downturns can have significant effects around the participation margin, through their influence on incomes, wealth, and employment. The role of education is found more limited than typically estimated, and confined to the low end of the gains distribution. Estimated characteristics of potential entrants relative to marginal stockholders suggest that further growth in participation poses considerable challenges, in view of more limited finances, younger age, more limited education and financial alertness, and above all significantly less self-declared willingness to assume financial risk by potential stockholders compared to marginal investors. The hurdle to financial practitioners interested in expanding the stockolder base is not estimated to be small."

Country Insurance,IFM,2004,"In this paper, we examine how the presence of country insurance schemes affects the policymaker’s incentives to undertake reforms. Such schemes (especially when made contingent on negative external shocks) are more likely to foster than to delay reform in crisis-prone volatile economies. The consequences of country insurance, however, hinge on the nature of the reforms being considered: “buffering”reforms, aimed at mitigating the cost of crises, may be partially discouraged by insurance; by contrast, insurance is likely to promote ""enhancing"" reforms that pay off relatively more in good times."

Cross Border Mergers and Acquisitions in Emerging Markets: The Stock Market Valuation of Corporate Control,IFM,2004,"Using a database that covers all transactions that involve a developed-market acquirer and an emerging-market target from 1988-2002, this paper studies the stock market’s reaction to M&A announcements in emerging markets. The evidence suggests that the stock market anticipates significant value creation from cross border transactions that involve an emerging market targets. Panel data estimations show that, on average, monthly returns for target firms increase by 5.05 to 6.68 percent in alternative specifications when a cross border M&A transaction is announced, while acquirer returns increase, on average, by 1.65 to 3.05 percent. The benefits of the M&A transactions stem from the transfer of majority control from emerging market targets to developed market acquirers. Overall, the results suggest that the boom in cross border mergers and acquisitions in emerging markets in the late 1990s led to substantial gains for shareholders of both acquiring and target firms."
"Default Risk, the Real Exchange Rate and Income Fluctuations in Emerging Economies",IFM,2004,"Volatile and countercyclical country interest rates and dollar-denominated debt are common features of emerging economies. This paper develops a two-sector small open economy model to study endogenous default risk and its interaction with the real exchange rate and income. Default probabilities and country risk premia depend on incentives for repayment. Default occurs in equilibrium because asset markets are incomplete. The model predicts that default incentives and default premia are higher in recessions, as observed in the data. The reason is that in a recession, a risk averse borrower finds it more costly to repay non-contingent debt and is more likely to default. In a quantitative exercise, the model matches several features of the Argentinian economy and can account for the dynamics observed during the recent default episode. Prior to default, the economy experiences higher interest rate premia, capital outflows, real exchange rate depreciation, and collapses in consumption. An important feature of the model is that economies with relatively small tradable sectors have higher incentives to default on dollar denominated debt and thus have larger default probabilities."
On the Empirics of Sudden Stops: The Relevance of Balance-Sheet Effects,IFM,2004,"Using a sample of 32 developed and developing countries we analyze the empirical characteristics of sudden stops in capital flows and the relevance of balance sheet effects in the likelihood of their materialization. We find that large real exchange rate (RER) fluctuations coming hand in hand with Sudden Stops are basically an emerging market (EM) phenomenon. Sudden Stops seem to come in bunches, grouping together countries that are different in many respects. However, countries are similar in that they remain vulnerable to large RER fluctuations – be it because they could be forced to large adjustments in the absorption of tradable goods, and/or because the size of dollar liabilities in the banking system (i.e., domestic liability dollarization, or DLD) is high. Openness, understood as a large supply of tradable goods that reduces leverage over the current account deficit, coupled with DLD, are key determinants of the probability of Sudden Stops. The relationship between  Openness and DLD in the determination of the probability of Sudden Stops is highly non-linear, implying that the interaction of high current account leverage and high dollarization may be a dangerous cocktail."
Persistence in Law-of-One-Price Deviations: Evidence from Micro-data,IFM,2004,We study the dynamics of good-by-good real exchange rates using a micro-panel of 270 goods prices drawn from major cities in 71 countries and 245 goods prices drawn from 13 major U.S. cities. We find half-lives of deviations from the Law-of-One-Price for the average good is about 1 year; somewhat lower for U.S. cities and somewhat higher for cities in the OECD with LDC cities in between. This speed of adjustment is well below the concensus range of estimates of 3 to 5 years for purchasing power parity deviations yet consistent with plausible ‘price-stickiness.’ We further construct price indices using our micro data and find that aggregation bias combined with small sample bias accounts for a large part of the difference between micro and macro estimates for the OECD.
Price Convergence: Whats on TV?,IFM,2004,"We use a unique dataset on television prices across European countries and regions to investigate the sources of differences in price levels. Our findings are as follows: (i) Quality is a crucial determinant of price differences. Even in an integrated economic zone as Europe, rich economies tend to consume higher quality goods. This effect accounts for the lion’s share of international price dispersion. (ii) However, sizable international price differentials subsist even for the same television sets (the average bilateral price difference is as high as 80 euros, or 8% of the average TV price in our sample). (iii) EMU countries display lower price dispersion than non-EMU countries (iv) Price dispersion tends to be smaller regionally than internationally. Regional price dispersion is comparable to intra-EMU dispersion (v) Absolute price differentials and relative price volatility are positively correlated with exchange rate volatility. (vi) Brand premia and relative rankings of brands differ markedly across borders. (vii) Structural estimates allow a more precise quantification of preference heterogeneity across borders."

Slow Passthrough Around the World: A New Import for Developing Countries?,IFM,2004,"Developing countries traditionally experience passthrough of exchange rate changes that is greater and more rapid than high-income countries experience. This is true equally of the determination of prices of imported goods, prices of local competitors’ products, and the general CPI. But developing countries in the 1990s experienced a rapid downward trend in the degree of passthrough and speed of adjustment, more so than did high-income countries. As a consequence, slow and incomplete passthrough is no longer exclusively a luxury of industrial countries. Using a new data set -- prices of eight narrowly defined brand commodities, observed in 76 countries -- we find empirical support for some of the factors that have been hypothesized in the literature, but not for others. Significant determinants of the passthrough coefficient include per capita incomes, bilateral distance, tariffs, country size, wages, long-term inflation, and long-term exchange rate variability. Some of these factors changed during the 1990s. Part (and only part) of the downward trend in passthrough to imported goods prices, and in turn to competitors’ prices and the CPI, can be explained by changes in the monetary environment – including a fall in long-term inflation. Real wages work to reduce passthrough to competitors’ prices and the CPI, confirming the hypothesized role of distribution and retail costs in pricing to market. Rising distribution costs, due perhaps to the Balassa-Samuelson-Baumol effect, could contribute to the decline in the passthrough coefficient in some developing countries."
"Stabilization, Competitiveness and Risk-sharing: A Model of Monetary Interdependence",IFM,2004,"This paper provides a stylized choice-theoretic model to analyze optimal monetary policies among interdependent economies. In response to macroeconomic shocks, policymakers strike a balance between two objectives. The first is to stabilize marginal costs and markups to offset the distortions associated with nominal rigidities, a dimension that entails no international tension. The second is to influence the terms of international trading in contingent assets. Through this channel, policymakers aim at lowering the relative prices of domestic goods, leading to a transfer of world income in favor of the country’s residents. This dimension then entails a zero-sum redistribution of welfare across countries. Conducting monetary policy in a coordinated fashion allows policymakers to completely focus on the stabilization objective. While cooperation improves welfare from a worldwide point of view, this need not be true from a national perspective, as the larger country is better off when monetary policy is conducted in a decentralized fashion."
Structuring and Restructuring Sovereign Debt: The Role of Seniority,IFM,2004,"Most studies of sovereign debt focus on two major moral hazard problems: the sovereign’s incentive to strategically default on its debts and the lenders’ excessively lax lending itself driven by the anticipation of IMF bailouts. Here, we concentrate on another major moral hazard problem that arises in the absence of IMF bailouts: debt dilution. We show that to forestall debt dilution sovereigns have an incentive to make their debt excessively difficult to restructure. We argue that a policy intervention that would make seniority and priority in sovereign debt legally enforceable would at the same time eliminate this distortion towards excessively hard and fragile debt and prevent overborrowing when sovereigns are approaching financial distress."
The Magic of the Exchange Rate: Optimal Escape from a Liquidity Trap in Small and Large Open Economies,IFM,2004,"The optimal escape from a liquidity trap involves generating private-sector expectations of a higher future price level and higher future inflation. This lowers the real interest rate and reduces the recession during the liquidity trap. The problem, emphasized by Krugman, is that central-bank promises of a higher future price level may not be credible. The current exchange rate will be a good indicator of private-sector expectations of the future price level. An intentional currency depreciation (which is technically feasible) will create private-sector expectations of a future weaker currency and a higher future price level. An intentional currency depreciation and a crawling peg (as in the Foolproof Way) can implement the optimal escape from a liquidity trap and make this credible. Optimal escape from a liquidity trap in a large economy does not prevent the rest of the world from achieving its monetary-policy objectives, if the rest of the world is not in a liquidity trap. For negative international output externalities (which may not be very realistic, since they rely on optimal international risk sharing), the rest of the world may fall into a liquidity trap. This nevertheless moves the world equilibrium towards the equilibrium corresponding to optimal international cooperation. For positive international output externalities, any initial liquidity trap in the rest of the world is alleviated or eliminated."

Futures Prices as Risk Adjusted Forecasts of Monetary Policy,ME,2004,"Many researchers have used federal funds futures rates as measures of financial markets’ expectations of future monetary policy. However, to the extent that federal funds futures reflect risk premia, these measures require some adjustment to account for these premia. In this paper, we document that excess returns on federal funds futures have been positive on average and strongly countercyclical. In particular, excess returns are surprisingly well predicted by macroeconomic indicators such as employment growth and financial business-cycle indicators such as Treasury yield spreads and corporate bond spreads. Excess returns on eurodollar futures display similar patterns. We document that simply ignoring these risk premia has important consequences for the expected future path of monetary policy. We also show that risk premia matter for some futures-based measures of monetary policy surprises used in the literature."
Monetary Policy and Inflation Dynamics,ME,2004,"Since the early 1980s, there have been some important changes in the behavior of the United States economy. In particular, inflation now rises considerably less when unemployment falls. In addition, the volatility of output and inflation have fallen sharply. In this paper, I use simulations of both small-scale and large-scale macroeconomic models to explore whether changes in monetary policy can account for these phenomena. I find that changes in monetary policy can account for most or all of the change in the inflation-unemployment relationship. As others have found, changes in the parameters and shock volatility of monetary-policy reaction functions can explain only a small portion of the decline in the volatility of output growth. However, I find that changes in policy can explain a much larger proportion of the reduction in the volatility of the output gap. I also find that a broader concept of monetary-policy changes—one that includes improvements in the ability of the central bank to measure potential output—helps enhance the ability of monetary policy to account for the changes in output and inflation volatility and in the relationship between inflation and unemployment."

Were There Regime Switches in US Monetary Policy?,ME,2004,"A multivariate model, identifying monetary policy and allowing for simultaneity and regime switching in coefficients and variances, is confronted with US data since 1959. The best fit is with a model that allows time variation in structural disturbance variances only. Among models that allow for changes in equation coefficients also, the best fit is for a model that allows coefficients to change only in the monetary policy rule. That model allows switching among three main regimes and one rarely and briefly occurring regime. The three main regimes correspond roughly to periods when most observers believe that monetary policy actually differed, and the differences in policy behavior are substantively interesting, though statistically ill-determined. The estimates imply monetary targeting was central in the early 80’s, but also important sporadically in the 70’s. The changes in regime were essential neither to the rise in inflation in the 70’s nor to its decline in the 80’s."
Why Inflation Rose and Fell: Policymakers= Beliefs and US Postwar Stabilization Policy,ME,2004,"This paper provides an explanation for the run-up of US inflation in the 1960s and 1970s and the sharp disinflation in the early 1980s, which standard macroeconomic models have difficulties in addressing. I present a model in which rational policymakers learn about the behavior of the economy in real time and set stabilization policy optimally, conditional on their current beliefs. The steady state associated with the model’s self-confirming equilibrium is characterized by low inflation. However, prolonged and asymmetric episodes of high inflation can occur when policymakers underestimate both the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment and the persistence of inflation in the Phillips curve. I estimate the model using likelihood methods. The estimation results show that the model accounts remarkably well for the evolution of policymakers’ beliefs, stabilization policy and the postwar behavior of inflation and unemployment in the United States."
A Search for Multiple Equilibria in Urban Industrial Structure,PERE,2004,
Agglomeration Economies and the High-Tech Computer Cluster,PERE,2004,"This paper considers the effects of agglomeration on the production decisions of firms in the high-tech computer cluster. We build upon an alternative definition of the high-tech computer cluster developed by Bardhan et al. (2003) and we exploit a new data source, the National Establishment Time-Series (NETS) Database, to analyze the spatial distribution of firms in this industry. An essential contribution of this research is the recognition that high-tech firms are heterogeneous collections of establishments. We explicitly model the kinship relationships between the headquarters and establishments of these firms and account for their endogenous production technology choices using controls for the spatial and functional configurations of each firm’s establishment locations. The empirical results, from our preferred specification of a random parameters restricted maximum likelihood (REML) production function, are broadly consistent with several recent theoretical models of supply chain management under incomplete contracting (Combes and Duranton (2003), Almazan et al. (2003), and Rotemberg and Saloner (2000)). We find statistically significant and economically meaningful localization effects on high-tech firms’ labor input technology arising from MSA-level proximity to workers in computer services Standard Industrial Classifications (SICs) and establishment-level geographic interactivity. We also find that localization effects have economically significant impacts on the elasticities of other purchased inputs. The channels for these effects are again access to large computer services labor markets and geographically dispersed networks of establishments. Our empirical results indicate that there are few benefits associated with firm locations in labor markets with large numbers of employees in the computer manufacturing sectors. This negative result may reflect the culmination of recent trends in out-sourcing manufactured inputs to distant offshore subsidiaries. Finally, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in the production technologies exploited by firms in the high-tech computer cluster, although in general, the production technology of this industry is characterized by constant returns to scale."
Community Heterogeneity and Local Response to Fiscal Incentives,PERE,2004,"One of the most important functions of local government is providing public education. There is, however, variation in preferences for school expenditure among different local groups. How the preferences of heterogeneous groups affect school spending is an important question for public policy. In this paper, I examine the unintended effects of a tax relief program in New York State that lowered the marginal cost of educational expenditure to homeowners by paying a portion of their property taxes to school districts. I find these fiscal incentives had statistically and economically significant effects on local government behavior; school expenditures rose by 1.6% on average in response to the state paying 10% of all local property taxes. Moreover, I find that the distribution of tax relief across local taxpayers and the mobility of non-residential property were important determinants of local response. My results suggest that, as a group, homeowners are relatively more influential on local decisions to increase expenditure than renters or owners of non-residential property, and that local taxpayers perceive significantly higher long-run costs to raising taxes on commercial and industrial property relative to more immobile property, such as vacant land. These findings highlight a potentially important issue that has received little attention in the literature on fiscal federalism: policies that seek to change local public expenditure may be made more effective by focusing on the preferences of more influential groups of local taxpayers."
Consumption Commitments and Asset Prices,PERE,2004,"This paper studies portfolio choice and asset prices in a model with two consumption goods, one of which involves a commitment in that its consumption can only be adjusted at a cost. Commitments effectively make investors more risk averse: they invest less in risky assets and smooth total consumption more. Aggregating over a population of such consumers implies dynamics that match those of a representative consumer economy with habit formation. Calibrations show that the model can resolve the equity premium puzzle. We test the key prediction that an exogenous increase in economic commitments (e.g., housing) causes a more conservative portfolio allocation using a novel instrumental variables strategy related to age at marriage. We find that a $1 increase in housing causes a 50-70 cent reallocation from stocks to bonds for the average investor. Exploiting differences in the variance of home prices across cities, we show that this effect is due to commitments and not greater exposure to housing price risk."
On the Political Economy of Tax Limits,PERE,2004,"We study the political economy of state limitations on the taxing powers of local governments, investigating the effects of such restriction on housing markets, community composition, and types of taxes and expenditures undertaken by local governments. We characterize equilibrium when voters choose values of multiple policy (tax and expenditure) instruments, finding that tax limitations have very substantial effects on housing prices and the composition of communities. Household relocation following introduction of tax limits results in an increase in median incomes in all communities. The electorates of communities then adopt policies quite different from those that prevail in the absence of tax limitations, reducing expenditures on redistribution while preserving or increasing per capita expenditures on public good provision. Political support for tax limits comes from suburban voters and from a subset of central-city voters who benefit from increased public service expenditures and reduced deadweight losses in housing markets. These results accord well with the hypothesis of Vigdor (2001)—that much political support for tax limits comes from a desire by individuals to limit taxes in localities other than their own. Our model permits characterization of voting equilibrium when there are multiple policy instruments and provides a novel application of the Besley and Coate (1997) model of representative democracy."
Robin Hood and His Not-So-Merry Plan: Capitalization and the Self-Destruction of Texas= School Finance Equalization Plan,PERE,2004,"Texas' ""Robin Hood"" school finance scheme was enacted in 1994. A decade later, it controls the allocation of about $30 billion dollars a year, but is collapsing and likely to be abandoned. We show that the collapse was predictable. Robin Hood's design maximizes the negative capitalization it causes, shrinking its own tax base. It relies only slightly on relatively efficient (pseudo lump sum) redistibution and heavily on high marginal tax rates. Although Robin Hood reduced the spending gap between Texas' property-poor and property-rich districts by about $500 per pupil, it cost about $27,000 per pupil in lost property wealth, an amount that–if invested–would generate sufficient annual income to chose the spending gap entirely. The Robin Hood scheme is not odd: other states' systems share its features to some degree. We provide estimates of the effects of school finance system parameters, which would allow future policy makers to design systems that are more efficient, stable, and supportive of school spending."

Asset Pricing with Limited Risk Sharing and Heterogeneous Agents,AP,2005,"We solve a model with incomplete markets and heterogeneous agents that generates a large equity premium, while simultaneously matching stock market participation and individual asset holdings. The high risk premium is driven by incomplete risk sharing among stockholders, which results from the combination of borrowing constraints and (realistically) calibrated life-cycle earnings profiles, subject to both aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. We show that it is challenging to simultaneously match aggregate quantities (asset prices) and individual quantities (asset allocations). Furthermore, limited participation has a negligible impact on the risk premium, contrary to the results of models where it is imposed exogenously."
Growth or Glamour? Fundamentals and Systematic Risk in Stock Returns,AP,2005,"The cash flows of growth stocks are particularly sensitive to temporary movements in aggregate stock prices (driven by movements in the equity risk premium), while the cash flows of value stocks are particularly sensitive to permanent movements in aggregate stock prices (driven by market-wide shocks to cash flows.) Thus the high betas of growth stocks with the market’s discount-rate shocks, and of value stocks with the market’s cash-flow shocks, are determined by the cash-flow fundamentals of  growth and value companies. Growth stocks are not merely “glamour stocks” whose systematic risks are purely driven by investor sentiment. More generally, accounting measures of firm-level risk have predictive power for firms’ betas with market-wide cash flows, and this predictive power arises from the behavior of firms’ cash flows. The systematic risks of stocks with similar accounting characteristics are primarily driven by the systematic risks of their fundamentals."

Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity,AP,2005,"We provide a model that links a security’s market liquidity — i.e., the ease of trading it — and traders’ funding liquidity — i.e., their availability of funds. Traders provide market liquidity and their ability to do so depends on their funding, that is, their capital and the margins charged by their financiers. In times of crisis, reductions in market liquidity and funding liquidity are mutually reinforcing, leading to a liquidity spiral. The model provides a natural explanation for the empirically documented features that market liquidity (i) can suddenly  dry up (i.e. is fragile), (ii) has commonality across securities, (iii) is related to volatility, (iv) experiences “flight to liquidity” events, and (v) comoves with the market. Finally, the model shows how the Fed can improve current market liquidity by committing to improve funding in a potential future crisis."
Speculative Trading and Stock Prices: Evidence from Chinese A-B Share Premia,AP,2005,"The market dynamics of technology stocks in the late nineties has stimulated a growing body of theories that analyze the joint effects of short-sales constraints and heterogeneous beliefs on stock prices and trading volume. This paper examines implications of these theories using a unique data sample from China, a market with stringent short-sales constraints and perfectly segmented dual-class shares. The identical rights of the dual-class shares allow us to control for stock fundamentals. We find that trading caused by  investors’ speculative motive can help explain a significant fraction of the price difference between the dual-class shares."
Takeovers and the Cross-Section of Returns,AP,2005,"This paper considers the impact of takeover (or acquisition) likelihood on firm valuation. If takeover activity responds to investor expectations of future rates of return, and hence to time variation in risk premia, firms more likely to be takeover targets will have greater exposure to the state variable(s) related to time-varying risk premia. We show that firms exposed to takeovers have a higher required rate of return and yet a higher value than similar firms that are protected from takeovers. To test the framework, we estimate the likelihood that a firm will be acquired and create a takeover-spread portfolio that buys firms with a high likelihood of being acquired and shorts firms with low likelihood of being acquired. Such a takeover-spread portfolio should proxy for state variables related to time-varying risk premia. The takeover-spread portfolio generates annualized abnormal returns of up to 11.5% between 1980 and 2004, and is important in explaining cross-sectional differences in equity returns. Finally, we provide an explanation for the existence of abnormal returns associated with governance-spread portfolios (Gompers, Ishii and Metrick, 2003 and Cremers and Nair, 2005)."
Testing Factor-Model Explanations of Market Anomalies,AP,2005,"A set of recent papers attempts to explain the size and book-to-market anomalies with either: (1) conditional CAPM or Consumption-CAPM models with economically motivated conditioning variables, or (2) factor models based on economically motivated factors. The tests of these models use similar methodologies, similar test assets, and each test fails to reject the proposed model. This is surprising, as the correlation between the proposed factors is very small. We argue that many or all of these tests may fail to reject as a result of low statistical power. We propose an alternative test methodology which provides higher power against reasonable alternative hypotheses, and show that the new test methodology results in the rejection of several of the proposed factor models at high levels of statistical significance."
The Returns on Human Capital: Good News on Wall Street is Bad News on Main Street,AP,2005,"We use a standard single-agent model to conduct a simple consumption growth accounting exercise. Consumption growth is driven by news about current and expected future returns on the market portfolio. The market portfolio includes financial and human wealth. We impute the residual of consumption growth innovations that cannot be attributed to either news about financial asset returns or future labor income growth to news about expected future returns on human wealth, and we back out the implied human wealth and market return process. This accounting procedure only depends on the agent’s willingness to substitute consumption over time, not her consumption risk preferences. We find that innovations in current and future human wealth returns are negatively correlated with innovations in current and future financial asset returns, regardless of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. The evidence from the cross-section of stock returns suggests that the market return we back out of aggregate consumption innovations is a better measure of market risk than the return on the stock market."

Bottom-Up Corporate Governance,CF,2005,"In many instances, “independently minded” top ranking executives can impose strong discipline on their CEO, even though they are formally under his authority. This paper argues that the use of such a disciplining mechanism is a key feature of good corporate governance. We provide robust empirical evidence consistent with the fact that firms with high internal governance are more efficiently run. We empirically label as ”independent from the CEO” a top executive who joined the firm before the current CEO was appointed. In a very robust way, firms with a smaller fraction of independent executives exhibit (1) a lower level of profitability and (2) lower shareholder returns after large acquisitions. These results are unaffected when we control for traditional governance measures like board independence or other well-studied shareholder friendly provisions."
Financial Integration and Entrepreneurial Activity: Evidence from Foreign Bank Entry in Emerging Markets,CF,2005,"An extensive empirical literature has documented the positive growth effects of equity market liberalization. However, this line of research ignores the impact of financial integration on a category of firms crucial for economic development, i.e. the small entrepreneurial firms. This paper aims to fill this void. We employ a large panel containing almost 60,000 firm–year observations on listed and unlisted companies in Eastern European economies to assess the differential impact of foreign bank lending on firm growth and financing. Foreign lending stimulates growth in firm sales, assets, and leverage, but the effect is dampened for small firms. We also find that the most connected businesses benefit least from foreign bank entry. This finding suggests that foreign banks can help mitigate connected lending problems and improve capital allocation."
"How Does Organizational Form Matter? Communication, Distance and Soft Information",CF,2005,"This paper empirically examines how both soft and hard information are transmitted and used within an organization. I explore the hierarchical decision-making approval process of corporate loans in a foreign bank in Argentina for this purpose. Results suggests that loans that go to higher levels for approval embed more hard relative to soft information in explaining credit availability. These results are robust to alternative measures of the vertical dimension in the organization such as: the level of approval, the total number of signatures in the approval process and the total time taken to approve the loan. I also analyze whether geographic location of the ultimate offi cer approving the loan impacts these results. I find that loans that are approved inside the branch rely significantly more on soft information compared to loans approved elsewhere. Direct communication with the ultimate layer approving the loan implies that soft is relatively more used than hard information. Transmission of soft information is easier if direct personal communication is feasible. I use several complexity measures to analyze alternative channels that could potentially explain the previous results and find that results are robust to the inclusion of such measures. Finally, I question the definition of both hard and soft information measures. Results show that soft information can be transmitted and used along the hierarchical levels, and that further qualifying hard information matters. Namely, I find higher reliance on soft information even at higher hierarchical levels when hard information is not reliable. These last results raise questions regarding the validity of the main assumptions for “non-transmission” of soft information used by current theoretical models of organizational structure."
Is Cash Negative Debt? A Hedging Perspective on Corporate Financial Policies,CF,2005,
New or Used? Investment with Credit Constraints,CF,2005,"This paper studies the choice between investment in new and used capital. We argue that used capital inherently relaxes credit constraints and thus firms which are credit constrained invest in used capital. Used capital is cheap relative to new capital in terms of its purchase price but requires substantial maintenance payments later on. The timing of these investment cash outflows makes used capital attractive for credit constrained firms. While used capital is expensive when evaluated using the discount factor of an agent with a high level of internal funds, it is relatively cheap when evaluated from the vantage point of a credit constrained agent with few internal funds. We provide an overlapping generations model and determine the price of used capital in equilibrium. Agents with less internal funds are more credit constrained, invest in used capital, and start smaller firms. Empirically, we find that the fraction of investment in used capital is substantially higher for small firms and varies significantly with measures of financial constraints with the predicted sign."
Optimism and Economic Choice,CF,2005,"This paper presents some of the first large-scale survey evidence linking optimism to major economic choices. We create a novel measure of optimism using the Survey of Consumer Finance by comparing a person’s self-reported life expectancy to that implied by statistical tables. Optimists are more likely to believe that future economic conditions will improve. Self-employed respondents are more optimistic than regular wage earners. In general, more optimistic people work harder and anticipate longer age-adjusted work careers. They are more likely to remarry, conditional on divorce. In addition, they tilt their investment portfolios more toward individual stocks."

Tracing the Impact of Bank Liquidity Shocks,CF,2005,"Do shocks to the supply of a bank’s liquidity affect its lending? If so, are client firms able to compensate or does the shock decrease their total borrowing? Does this in turn lead to greater firm bankruptcy? Identifying these supply side effects has proven difficult because of problems in separating contemporaneous demand from supply shocks and a lack of micro data linking banks to borrowing firms. Liquidity shocks arising from unanticipated nuclear tests in Pakistan in 1998, and a dataset linking over 18; 000 firms to all 145 banks in the economy provides a unique opportunity to answer these questions. First, we isolate the causal impact of the bank lending channel by showing that for the same firm borrowing from two different banks, its loan from the bank experiencing a 1% larger decline in liquidity drops by an additional 0.37%. The liquidity shock also leads to large declines in the probability of continued lending to old clients, and extending credit to new ones. Second, we find that while firms with multiple banking relationships fully compensate for the liquidity shock  by borrowing more from more liquid banks, single relationship firms are unable to do so. As such single relationship firms face substantial and persistent drops in total borrowing. Finally, such firms are also more likely to experience financial distress in terms of greater loan default. Liquidity shocks can thus have significant and persistent distributional impacts on the economy."
Why Are Buyouts Leveraged? The Financial Structure of Private Equity Funds,CF,2005,"This paper presents a model of the financial structure of private equity firms. In the model, the general partner of the firm encounters a sequence of deals over time where the exact quality of each deal cannot be credibly communicated to investors. We show that the optimal financing arrangement is consistent with a number of characteristics of the private equity industry. First, the firm should be financed by a combination of fund capital raised before deals are encountered, and deal-specific capital raised after a deal is encountered. Second, the fund investors’ claim on fund cash flow is a combination of debt and levered equity, while the general partner receives a claim similar to the carry contracts observed in reality. Third, the model suggests that investments by private equity firms will exhibit cyclicality, since there is overinvestment in good states of the world and underinvestment in bad states. Fourth, investments made in recessions will on average outperform investments made in booms."

"A, B, C's (and D)'s For Understanding VARS",EFCE,2005,"The dynamics of a linear (or linearized) dynamic stochastic economic model can be expressed in terms of matrices (A, B,C, D) that define a state space system. An associated state space system (A, K,C, Σ) determines a vector autoregression for observables available to an econometrician. We review circumstances under which the impulse response of the VAR resembles the impulse response associated with the economic model. We give four examples that illustrate a simple condition for checking whether the mapping from VAR shocks to economic shocks is invertible. The condition applies when there are equal numbers of VAR and economic shocks."
Assessing Structural VARs,EFCE,2005,"We use artificial data generated from variants of a simple real business cycle model to evaluate the ability of structural VARs to estimate the dynamic response of the economy to shocks. All the variants of the model economies considered in this paper imply that VAR-based methods that use short run restrictions are remarkably accurate. We also consider the performance of standard VAR-based estimators when long-run identifying restrictions are used. The parameterization of our model that is estimated by maximum likelihood implies that these methods also work well, in terms of bias and in terms of standard estimators of the degree of sampling variation. When we consider the models in Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2005), we confirm their finding that estimated impulse response functions based on long-run restrictions are distorted. We diagnose the reasons for the distortions, and build on our diagnosis to develop an improved estimator of impulse response functions based on long-run restrictions. It is not clear, however, whether the problems identified by CKM are of concern in practice. The CKM models are rejected overwhelmingly by the data."

Portfolio Inertia and Stock Market Fluctuations,EFEL,2005,"Relatively few studies have focused on household stock trading behavior, as opposed to current participation. Existing studies based on administrative brokerage data find excessive trading to the detriment of stockholders, while those based on retirement accounts find extreme inactivity. This paper uses data representative of the population to document the extent of household portfolio inertia in the face of the spread of equity culture and of considerable stock market index movements, and to link it to household characteristics. We document considerable portfolio inertia, both as regards changing participation status in the stock market and as regards trading stocks, and we find that the tendency to exhibit such inertia is linked to household characteristics. The stock market index influences considerably the tendency to trade directly held stocks through brokerage accounts. Although our findings suggest some dependence of overall participation and trading inertia on the performance of the stock market index, they do not indicate that the recent expansion in the stockholder base and the experience of the stock market downswing have significantly altered the overall propensity of households to trade in stocks or to switch participation status in a way that could contribute to stock market instability."
Private Debt and Income Inequality: A Business Cycle Analysis,EFEL,2005,
Technological Growth and Asset Pricing,EFEL,2005,"In this paper we study asset pricing in the presence of technological growth. We present a model, where new technologies arrive periodically, giving firms the opportunity to plant new trees of a better vintage. The model gives rise to an endogenous technological cycle that may have a duration longer than the business cycle. In its initial phase a substantial part of the stock market valuation is driven by growth options. P/E ratios and expected returns are high, and attain a maximum once firms start to invest in the new technologies. As the economy experiences an investment driven boom, growth opportunities get exploited, leading to decreased P/E ratios and lower future expected returns. We show that the recurrence of such cycles can account jointly for a considerable number of well documented asset pricing phenomena in both the time series and the cross section of expected returns. We also show how the model can provide a micro-foundation for empirical evidence documenting that several asset pricing phenomena are driven by “long-run” risks. In two concrete applications we show how the model can account for the weakening of cross sectional predictability between 1986-2001 and the recently documented sucess of the consumption CAPM over longer horizons."
The Welfare Cost of Bank Capital Requirements,EFEL,2005,"This paper measures the welfare cost of bank capital requirements and finds that the macroeconomic stakes involved with the design of capital adequacy regulation are large. A general equilibrium model with capital accumulation and a preference for liquidity is developed. Banks provide liquidity services by accepting deposits. A capital requirement plays a role, as it limits the moral hazard on the part of banks that is induced by the presence of a deposit insurance scheme. However, ceteris paribus, a higher capital requirement implies that banks can accept fewer deposits and thus provide fewer liquidity services to households. A key result is that equilibrium asset returns reveal the strength of households’ preferences for liquidity and it is shown that this allows for the derivation of a simple formula for the welfare cost of capital requirements that is a function only of observable variables. Using U.S. banking data, the cost of increasing the capital requirement by 10 percentage points is equivalent to a permanent loss in consumption of at least 0.1 to 0.2 percent."

What Can Rational Investors Do about Excessive Volatility,EFEL,2005,"We determine and analyze the trading strategy that would allow an investor to take advantage of the excessive stock price volatility that has been documented in the empirical literature on asset pricing. We construct a general equilibrium model where stock prices are excessively volatile because there are two classes of agents and one class places is overconfident about a public signal. As a result, these agents change their expectations too often, sometimes being excessively optimistic, sometimes being excessively pessimistic. We analyze the trading strategy of the rational investors who are not overconfident about the signal. While rational risk-arbitrageurs benefit from trading on their belief that the market is being foolish, when doing so they must hedge future fluctuations in the market’s foolishness. We find that fixed-income instruments can be used for the purpose of hedging. Thus, our analysis illustrates that risk arbitrage cannot be based on just a current price divergence; it must include also a protection against trading risk. We also show that the presence of a few rational traders is not sufficient to eliminate the excessive volatility effect of overconfident investors generated by the presence of overconfident investors. Furthermore, overconfident investors of this kind tend to survive for a long time before being driven out of the market by rational investors."

Efficient Fiscal Policy and Amplification,IFM,2005,"We provide a rationale for the observed pro-cyclicality of tax policies in emerging markets and present a novel mechanism through which tax policy amplifies the business cycle. Our explanation relies on two features of emerging markets: limited access to financial markets and limited commitment to tax policy. We present a small open economy model with capital where a government maximizes the utility of a working population that has no access to financial markets and is subject to endowment shocks. The government’s insurance motive generates pro-cyclical taxes on capital income. If the government could commit, this policy is not distortionary. However, we show that if the government lacks the ability to commit, the best fiscal policy available exacerbates the economic cycle by distorting investment during recessions. We characterize the mechanism through which limited commitment generates cycles in investment in an environment where under commitment investment would be constant. We extend our results to standard productivity shocks and to the case where the government has access to intra-period insurance markets. Lastly, we conjecture that our results would hold as well if the government could issue debt subject to borrowing constraints."
Portfolio Choice in a Monetary Open-Economy DSGE Model,IFM,2005,
Productivity Growth and the Exchange Rate Regime: The Role of Financial Development,IFM,2005,"This paper offers empirical evidence that a country’s choice of exchange rate regime can have a significant impact on its long-term rate of productivity growth. Moreover, the impact depends critically on the country’s level of financial development, its distance from the global technology frontier, and its degree of market regulation. We illustrate how each of these channels may operate in a simple stylized growth model in which real exchange rate uncertainty exacerbates the negative investment effects of domestic credit market constraints. The empirical analysis is based on an 83 country data set spanning the years 1960-2000. Our approach delivers results that are in striking contrast to the vast existing empirical exchange rate literature, which largely finds the effects of exchange rate volatility on real activity to be relatively small and insignificant."
Risk and Wealth in a Model of Self-Fulfilling Currency Attacks,IFM,2005,"Market participants’ risk attitudes, wealth and portfolio composition influence their positions in a pegged foreign currency and, therefore, may have important effects on the sustainability of currency pegs. We analyze such effects in a global game model of currency crises with continuous action choices. The model, solved in closed form, generates a rich set of theoretical predictions consistent with many popular and academic (unmodelled) speculations about the onset and timing of currency crises. The results extend linearly to a heterogeneous agent population."
"Sovereign Risk, Anonymous Markets, and the Effects of Globalization",IFM,2005,"The goal of this paper is to study the effects of globalization on the workings of financial markets. We adopt a “technological” view of globalization, which consists of an exogenous reduction in the cost of shipping goods across different regions of the world. We model financial markets where agents anonymously trade securities issued by every other agent in the world. In the absence of frictions, we show how globalization creates trade opportunities among residents of different regions of the world, thereby raising welfare. In the presence of sovereign risk, however, there emerge two crucial interactions between trade among residents within a region and trade among residents of different regions. First, the more residents within a region trade with each other, the more they can trade with residents of other regions. Second, the possibility  of trade with residents of other regions sometimes leads a government to not enforce payments by its residents, destroying trade opportunities among residents within the region. The net effect on welfare of this process of creation and destruction of trade opportunities is ambiguous. We argue that there are no policies governments can take to avoid the negative effects of globalization on trade among domestic residents. In a dynamic extension, we analyze how our results are affected by reputational considerations."
"Trade Costs, Pricing to Market and International Relative Prices",IFM,2005,
Vehicle Currency,IFM,2005,"An important feature of the international financial system is that it overwhelmingly uses a major currency, such as the US dollar, as a vehicle in the exchange between other currencies. In this paper we construct an equilibrium model to study this feature. The model economy has a finite number of countries, and each country's goods are sold only for the country's own currency. Households obtain foreign  currencies at trading posts. Each post involves one pair of currencies, and there is a fixed cost of operating the post. We study two types of equilibria. One is the symmetric trading equilibrium, in which there is an active post for every pair of currencies and so there is no vehicle currency. The other is the vehicle currency equilibrium, in which all countries exchange for a particular currency first and then use that currency to exchange for other currencies. We analyze how the use of a vehicle currency changes each country's consumption and welfare, relative to the symmetric equilibrium. We study the constraints on the inflation rate of the vehicle currency that must be satisfied in order for a currency to be a robust vehicle currency."
An Improved Annual Chronology of U.S. Business Cycles since the 1790's,ME,2005,"The NBER’s pre-WWI chronology of business cycles implies that the U.S. economy spent nearly every other year in recession. This paper extends earlier efforts at redating for the 1796-1914 period using a single metric: Davis’ (2004) annual industrial production index. This chronology alters more than 40% of the peak and troughs, and removes cycles long considered the most questionable. An important implication of the new chronology is the lack of discernible differences in the frequency and duration of industrial cycles among the pre-Civil War, Civil War to WWI, and post-WWII periods."
Borrowers' Financial Constraints and the Transmission of Monetary Policy: Evidence from Financial Conglomerates,ME,2005,"Exploring the functioning of internal capital markets in financial conglomerates, this paper conducts a novel test of the credit channel of monetary policy. We look at differences in the response of lending to monetary policy shocks across small banks that are affiliated with the same bank holding company but that operate in different geographical areas. These banks tap into the same pool of funds but face different pools of borrowers. Because small subsidiary banks concentrate their lending with small local businesses (whose fortunes are tied to their local economies), we can exploit cross-sectional differences in local economic conditions at the time of a monetary policy shock to study whether the strength of borrowers’ balance sheets influences the response of bank lending to policy. We find evidence that the negative response of bank loan growth to a monetary contraction is significantly more (less) pronounced when borrowers are more likely to have weak (strong) balance sheets. On the flip side, borrowers with weak balance sheets obtain more new bank credit than other borrowers in monetary expansions. Our results are consistent with the operation of a demand-driven transmission mechanism that works independently of the bank-supply (“lending”) channel. In fact, our estimates suggest that borrowers’ balance sheet strength accounts for a significant fraction of the “broad credit channel” of monetary policy."

Investment During the Korean Financial Crisis: The Role of Foreign-Denominated Debt,ME,2005,"Without capital market imperfections, the capital structure of a firm, including the size, the maturity and the currency compostion of debts, should not matter for investment decisions. The Asian financial crises provide a good opportunity to test this hypothesis. We approach the problem in two ways: First, we apply a conventional reduced form analysis to a panel data of Korean manufacturing firms, argueing that the devaluation that occurred during the crisis provides a natural experiment in which to assess the effect of balance sheet shocks to investment. Second, we specify a structural dynamic programming problem of a firm with foreign debts and financial constraints. We solve the dynamic programming problem using a nonlinear solution method and employ indirect inference to identify structural parameters. Both reduced-form evidence and structural parameter estimates imply an important role for finance in investment at the firm level. Our results also imply that foreign-denominated debt was not a major factor in depressing aggregate investment spending during the Korean financial crisis however. Furthermore, our results suggest that the devaluation on net improved the overall balance sheet position of firms and likely stimulated investment through the finance channel. These finding undermine support for the policy of maintaining fixed exchange rates during financial crises."
No-Arbitrage Taylor Rules,ME,2005,"We estimate Taylor (1993) rules and identify monetary policy shocks using no-arbitrage pricing techniques. Long-term interest rates are risk-adjusted expected values of future short rates and thus provide strong over-identifying restrictions about the policy rule used by the Federal Reserve. The no-arbitrage framework also accommodates backward-looking and forward-looking Taylor rules. We find that inflation and GDP growth account for over half of the time-variation of time-varying excess bond returns and we attribute almost all of the movements in the term spread to inflation. Taylor rules estimated with no-arbitrage restrictions differ significantly from Taylor rules estimated by OLS, and monetary policy shocks identified with no-arbitrage techniques are less volatile than their OLS counterparts."
Precautionary Savings and Entrepreneurship,ME,2005,"In this paper, we show the pivotal role entrepreneurs plays in estimating the importance of the precautionary saving motive. Since entrepreneurs hold larger amounts of wealth than other households and also face highly volatile income, they induce a correlation between wealth and income risk regardless of whether or not a precautionary saving motive exists. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in the 1980s and the 1990s, we show that the large wealth entrepreneurs hold is not due to the desire to insure themselves against shocks to income. In fact, both within the group of entrepreneurs and among non-entrepreneurs, the size of precautionary savings is modest and accounts for less than ten percent of total household wealth. However, pooling entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs together and using conventional measures of wealth and income risk leads to artificially high values of precautionary savings. Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) further confirms that precautionary savings accounts for only four percent of the wealth held by entrepreneurs and a higher but still modest share of wealth among other households. Thus, while a precautionary saving motive exists and affects all households, it does not give rise to high amounts of wealth in the economy, particularly among those households that face the most volatile stream of income."
Real Wage Rigidities and the New Keynesian Model,ME,2005,"The standard new Keynesian framework is often criticised for its lack of intrinsic inflation inertia, and the absence of a tradeoff between inflation and output gap stabilization. We argue that the introduction of real wage rigidities is a natural way to overcome those shortcomings. We propose a tractable modification of the new Keynesian framework that incorporates these rigidities and examine some of its implications. We also derive the model’s implied relation between inflation and unemployment, and estimate it using US data."
Robust Monetary Policy with Imperfect Knowledge,ME,2005,"We examine the performance and robustness properties of monetary policy rules in an estimated macroeconomic model in which the economy undergoes structural change and where private agents and the central bank possess imperfect knowledge about the true structure of the economy. Private agents rely on an adaptive learning technology to form expectations and update their beliefs based on incoming data. Policymakers follow an interest rate rule aiming to maintain price stability and to minimize fluctuations of unemployment around its natural rate but are uncertain about the economy’s natural rates of interest and unemployment. We show that in this environment the scope for economic stabilization is significantly reduced relative to an economy under rational expectations with perfect knowledge. Furthermore, policies that would be optimal under perfect knowledge can perform very poorly when knowledge is imperfect. Efficient policies that take account of private learning and misperceptions of natural rates call for more aggressive responses to inflation that would be optimal under perfect knowledge. We show that such policies not only improve performance in our baseline model, but are also quite robust to potential misspecification of private sector learning and the magnitude of variation in natural rates."
The Impact of Foreign Interest Rate Shocks on the Economy: The Role of the Exchange Rate Regime,ME,2005,"It is often argued that small economies are affected by shocks originating from large countries. This paper explores the connection between interest rates in major industrial countries and annual real output growth in other countries. Our results show that increases in large countries’ interest rates have a contractionary effect on annual real GDP growth in the domestic economy, but that this effect is centered on countries with fixed exchange rates. We then examine the potential channels through which large country interest rates affect small economies. The direct monetary policy channel is the most likely channel when compared to other possibilities, such as a general capital market effect or trade effect."
The Sustainability of Fiscal Policy in the United States,ME,2005,"The paper examines the sustainability of U.S. fiscal policy, finding substantial evidence in favor. I summarize the U.S. fiscal record from 1792-2003, critically review sustainability conditions and their testable implications, and apply them to U.S. data. I particularly emphasize the ramifications of economic growth. A “growth dividend” has historically covered the entire interest bill on the U.S. debt. Unit root tests on real series, unscaled by GDP, are distorted by the series’ severe heteroskedasticity. The most credible evidence in favor of sustainability is the robust positive response of primary surpluses to fluctuations in the debt-GDP ratio."
Towards a Dynamic Price Index,ME,2005,"The existing theory on cost-of-living price indices is built on the classical static model of consumption with certainty. This paper studies the construction of a price index that measures the cost of living for a consumer who lives for more than one period and faces uncertainty. It proposes one useful definition of a price index in these conditions: the DPI, for dynamic price index. The DPI has several interesting properties. First, the structure of financial markets is a key input into determining whether higher consumer prices raise or lower the DPI. Second, asset prices should be included in the DPI, with a potentially large weight. Third, if goods are durable then the slower they depreciate, the larger their weight should be in the DPI. This paper takes a first pass at quantitatively building a DPI for the post-war U.S. economy and finds that it provides a very different account of the inflation experience during this period."

Optimal Commodity Taxation When Land and Structures Must Be Taxed at the Same Rate,PERE,2005,"We show that the optimal property tax rate rises with the ratio of land rents to structure and land development costs. California’s high ratio of income to property tax revenue and the distribution of Federal housing subsidies thus appear geographically misplaced. Proportional taxation of non-housing commodities is not optimal, even when elasticities with respect to wages are identical. Absent externalities, the desirability of transportation taxes and“anti-sprawl” growth controls hinge on the relative importance of time versus money in commuting costs."
Racial Segregation and the Black-White Test Score Gap,PERE,2005,"Racial segregation is often blamed for part of the achievement gap between blacks and whites. In this paper we study the effects of school and neighborhood segregation on the relative SAT scores of black students across different metropolitan areas, using large microdata samples for the 1998-2001 test cohorts. Without controlling for neighborhood segregation, we find that school segregation is negatively associated with black relative test scores, and also with relative education and employment outcomes measured in the 2000 Census. In models that include both school and neighborhood segregation, however, the effect of relative exposure to black schoolmates is uniformly small and statistically insignificant, while neighborhood segregation has a strong negative effect. Instrumental variables estimates that isolate the components of school segregation associated with court-ordered desegregation plans or the geographic features of a city are consistent with this result but imprecise. Models that include school segregation, neighborhood segregation, and measures of the relative exposure of blacks to other characteristics of their neighbors (e.g. education and income) show weaker effects of neighborhood segregation, suggesting that the socio-economic status of neighbors, rather than their race, may be the primary source of these effects."
"Schools and Location: Tiebout, Alonso, and Governmental Policy; Can Money Buy a Better Education?",PERE,2005,"An important element in considering school finance policies is that households are not passive. Instead they respond to policies with a combination of modified residential choice and political choice of tax levels. The highly stylized decision models of most existing analyses, however, lead to concerns about the policy evaluations. In our general equilibrium model of residential location and community choice, households base optimizing decisions on commuting costs, school quality, and land rents. With both centralized and decentralized employment, the resulting equilibrium has heterogeneous communities in terms of income and tastes for schools. This model is used to analyze a series of conventional policy experiments, including school district consolidation, district power utilization, and different equalization devices. The important conclusion is that welfare falls for all families with the restrictions in choice that are implied by these approaches."
Separate When Equal? Racial Inequality and Residential Segregation,PERE,2005,"In contrast to conventional wisdom, this paper identifies a powerful mechanism which can lead to persistent and even increasing residential segregation when racial differences in education and other sociodemographics narrow. We document that middle-class black neighborhoods are in short supply in many U.S. metropolitan areas, forcing highly educated blacks either to live in white neighborhoods with high amenity levels or in more black neighborhoods with lower amenity levels. A simple model then shows that increases in the proportion of highly educated blacks in a metropolitan area may lead to the emergence of new middle-class black neighborhoods, relieving the prior neighborhood supply constraint and causing increases in residential segregation. Cross-MSA evidence from the 2000 Census indicates that this mechanism does in fact operate: as the proportion of highly educated blacks in an MSA increases, so the segregation of educated blacks and blacks more generally goes up. Our empirical findings are robust and have important implications for the evolution of residential segregation."
The Anatomy of a Housing Bubble,PERE,2005,"This paper studies the upswing in the Hong Kong residential housing prices during the mid-1990s. The market-wide index (CentaCity Index) experienced a real increase of 50 percent from 1995 to 1997, followed by a real decrease of 57 percent from 1997 to 2002. Using a panel data set of over 200 large-scale housing complexes (estates), this episode is explored in a cross-sectional manner. Dramatic increases in transaction volume during the price upswing and cross-sectional variation in the price behaviour are documented. To explain the price and volume movements under a unified framework, an application of a speculation model (Scheinkman & Xiong 2003) is put forward. The data give strong support for speculative activities fuelling the price upswing. While media reporting does not seem to have promoted the price upswing, uncertainties about the political future of Hong Kong around the Handover are likely to have played a role."
"The Investment Performance of Housing and a ""Hedonic"" Spatial Equilibrium",PERE,2005,"This research unites the two major strands of work that exist to date in the literature on Housing Markets. The first is the notion of spatial equilibrium wherein consumers inhabiting different units are thought to be at a constant utility level. As a consequence prices “compensate” for differential “hedonic” housing attributes. The second is the application of life-cycle analysis to the determination of the “full” cost of owning housing as a financial asset. Linking the two we hypothesize that it is the “risk-adjusted annual cost of ownership” which should compensate owners for the differential consumption flows that come from various houses. To test whether this is the case we develop a unique data set for 4 US metropolitan areas that ascertains the appreciation and risk from owning housing at the ZIP code level. We then combine this with transaction based data on price levels – at the same level of geographic detail. We find that in ZIP codes with higher historic appreciation, price levels are indeed higher, but we suspect that this may represent misspecification through an identity. When we test over a shorter period for whether prices anticipate future appreciation – we get very mixed results. In more than half of the specifications ex ante appreciation has the wrong sign. The results for risk are similarly disappointing. These results reinforce the doubts raised by others  over whether the housing market is “efficiently” priced. They also raise the possibility that three decades of “hedonic” research could possibly be biased by omitting the investment characteristics of housing assets from the estimated equations."
The Microfoundations of Hot and Cold Markets,PERE,2005,"This paper considers why markets characterized by costly search, such as housing markets, labor markets, or marriage markets, exhibit excess volatility. Conditions in these markets, including the ratio of buyers to sellers, transaction prices, and expected times-to-transaction, often appear highly sensitive to fundamental shocks. These high sensitivities result from feedback: market participants optimally respond to shocks in a manner that amplifies a shock’s initial impact, which in turn elicits further reinforcing response. For example, a positive demand shock brings more buyers into a market. This improves the bargaining position of sellers, who then sell more quickly, decreasing the stock of sellers in the market. This further increasing the relative number of buyers to sellers, amplifying the initial shock."
"Urbanization, Productivity and Innovation: Evidence from Investment in Higher Education",PERE,2005,"During the past fifteen years, Swedish government policy has decentralized post-secondary education throughout the country. We investigate the economic effects of this decentralization policy on the level of productivity and innovation and their spatial distribution in the Swedish economy. We analyze productivity, measured as output per worker at the level of the locality for 284 Swedish communities during a 14 year period, and innovation, measured by commercial patents awarded in 100 Swedish labor market areas during an 8 year period. These economic outcomes, together with data documenting the decentralization of university-based researchers, permit us to estimate the effects of exogenous changes in educational policy upon increases in productivity and the locus of innovative activity. We find important and significant effects of this policy upon economic output and the locus of knowledge production, suggesting that the decentralization has affected regional development through local innovation and increased creativity. Moreover, our evidence suggests that aggregate productivity was increased by the deliberate policy of decentralization."

Asset-Backed Securities: Costs and Benefits of Bankruptcy Remoteness,CF,2006,"This paper focuses on a key property of asset-backed securities (ABS); namely, that ABS are designed to achieve “bankruptcy remoteness” of the securitized assets from the borrowing firm. This provides lenders with maximal protection from dilution that is not available with other contracts, such as secured debt. ABS can have real effects in allowing firms to commit to more efficient investment decisions in bankruptcy. We show that securitization of replaceable assets (such as receivables) prevents inefficient continuation in bankruptcy, but securitization of necessary assets can lead to inefficient liquidations. In these circumstances, secured debt and/or leases can be preferred. Our model also predicts that greater legal risk of “bankruptcy remoteness” being undermined by courts leads to lower overall efficiency and higher interest rates for ABS investors. We test this second prediction using a controversial decision in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of LTV Steel, in which a securitization contract was unexpectedly treated as a secured loan. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that ABS spreads for securitizers eligible for Chapter 11 increased significantly more than spreads for insured bank securitizers, who are not Chapter 11-eligible, in the period following the LTV filing. The results demonstrate that the creditor protection provided by “bankruptcy remoteness” is indeed valuable and priced in financial markets."
Capital Structure with Risky Foreign Investment,CF,2006,"American multinational firms respond to politically risky environments by adjusting their capital structures abroad and at home. Foreign subsidiaries located in politically risky countries have significantly more debt than do other foreign affiliates of the same parent companies. American firms further limit their equity exposures in politically risky countries by sharing ownership with local partners and by serving foreign markets with exports rather than local production. The residual political risk borne by parent companies leads them to use less domestic leverage, resulting in lower firm-wide leverage. Multinational firms with above-average exposures to politically risky countries have 8.4 percent less domestic leverage than do other firms. These findings illustrate the impact of risk exposures on capital structure."
Concentrated Ownership and Labor Relations,CF,2006,"Political struggles between the emerging European liberal states and the Catholic church in the 18th and 19th centuries provoked the formation of highly oppositional labor movements, resulting in Catholic countries having conflictual labor relations until the present. Based on the premise that differences in the quality of labor relations across countries are, at least partly, the outcome of historical and cultural developments, we examine whether these differences have implications for the prevalence of family ownership. Controlling for differences in minority shareholder protection, we find that countries with hostile labor relations have significantly more concentrated ownership than countries with cooperative labor relations. This relationship is strikingly robust and holds even when we instrument our survey measure of the quality of labor relations using either the fraction of Catholics or Protestants 1900. It also holds when we replace our survey measure of the quality of labor relations with actual strike data from the 1960s. As it turns out, differences in strike activity in the 1960s across Western countries can predict differences in ownership concentration thirty years later. Finally, the relationship also holds for Canadian time-series data, for which we document a markedly strong correlation between strike activity and changes in ownership concentration during the second half of the 20th century."
Estimating the Effect of Hierarchies on Information Use,CF,2006,"We estimate the effect of hiearchical distance on the relative use of subjective and objective information. Credit approved at higher levels (that are more distant from the loan officer who collects information) relies relatively more on objective information and less on subjective information. Using loan-officer fixed effects, and non-linearities in “bank rules” that determine the hierarchical distance for a loan applicant, we show that endogenous assignment of applicants to hierarchical levels or loan-officers to applicants is unlikely to explain our results. The drop in reliance on subjective information at higher levels widens with subjectivity of information. However, the reliance on subjective information at higher levels improves dramatically if the loan approving officer sits in close proximity to the loan officer, or if the loan officer is more experienced."
Evidence on the Tradeoff between Risk and Return for IPO and SEO Firms,CF,2006,"Do the low long-run average returns of equity issuers reflect underperformance due to mispricing or the risk characteristics of the issuing firms? We shed new light on this question by examining how institutional lenders price loans of equity-issuing firms. We find that equity-issuing firms’ expected debt return is equivalent to the expected debt return of non-issuing firms with similar characteristics, implying that institutional lenders perceive equity issuers to be as risky as similar non-issuing firms. We also find that institutional lenders perceive small and high book-to-market borrowers as systematically riskier than larger borrowers with low book-to-market ratios, consistent with the asset pricing approach in Fama and French (1993). Finally, we find that firms’ expected debt returns decline after equity offerings, consistent with recent theoretical arguments suggesting that firm risk should decline following an equity offering if equity is issued to exercise a real option. Overall, our analysis provides novel evidence consistent with risk-based explanations for the observed equity returns following IPOs and SEOs."

"Leasing, Ability to Repossess, and Debt Capacity",CF,2006,"This paper studies the role of leasing of productive assets. When capital is leased (or rented), it is more easily repossessed and hence leasing has higher debt capacity than secured lending and relaxes financing constraints. However, leasing gives rise to an agency problem with regard to the care with which the leased asset is used or maintained. We show that this implies that more credit constrained firms lease capital, while less credit constrained firms buy capital. Our theory is consistent with the explanation of leasing provided by leasing firms, namely that leasing “preserves capital,” which is generally considered a fallacy in the academic literature. We provide empirical evidence that small and credit constrained firms lease a considerably larger fraction of their capital than larger and less constrained firms."
Risk Shifting versus Risk Management: Investment Policy in Corporate Pension Plans,CF,2006,"Firms financed with debt face conflicting incentives with respect to the management of cash flow risks. Risk reduction can benefit liquidity constrained firms, but increased risk taking can increase the value of shareholders’ equity through asset substitution when firms are close to default. In this paper I examine these conflicting motivations in a setting where risk shifting incentives should be particularly strong: the investment of defined benefit pension plans sponsored by U.S. companies. Empirically, firms with poorly funded pension plans allocate a greater share of pension fund assets to safer securities such as  government debt and cash, whereas well-funded plans invest more heavily in volatile asset classes such as equity. Among large public firms, those with better credit ratings allocate greater shares of pension fund assets to equity and smaller shares to government debt and cash. These relations hold both in the cross-section and within firms and plans over time. The higher the probability of bankruptcy, the safer the observed pension fund asset allocation. Furthermore, the realized investment return volatility of plans that eventually terminate in financial distress is no greater than that of plans that do not terminate. I conclude that the incentive to limit the cash flow risk from pensions plays a considerably larger role than risk shifting in explaining pension fund investment policy among U.S. firms."
The Real Effects of Debt Certification: Evidence from the Introduction of Bank Loan Ratings,CF,2006,"I examine the introduction of syndicated bank loan ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s in 1995 to evaluate whether third-party rating agencies affect firm financial and investment policy. I find that the introduction of bank loan ratings leads to an increase in the use of debt by firms that obtain a rating, and in increases in firms’ asset growth and cash acquisitions. A loan level analysis demonstrates that borrowers that obtain a loan rating gain increased access to the capital of less informed investors such as foreign banks and non-bank institutional investors. The effects of the loan rating are strongest among firms that are of lower credit quality and do not have an existing public debt rating before bank loan ratings are introduced. This pattern suggests that third-party debt certification expands the supply of available debt financing, which leads to real effects on firm investment policy."
The Risk-Adjusted Cost of Financial Distress,CF,2006,
A New Keynesian Model with Unemployment,EFCE,2006,"We develop a utility based model of fluctuations, with nominal rigidities, and unemployment. In doing so, we combine two strands of research, the New Keynesian model with its focus on nominal rigidities, and the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, with its focus on labor market frictions and unemployment. In developing this model, we proceed in two steps. We first leave nominal rigidities aside. We show that, under a standard utility specification, productivity shocks have no effect on unemployment in the constrained efficient allocation. We then focus on the implications of alternative real wage setting mechanisms for fluctuations in unemployment. We then introduce nominal rigidities in the form of staggered price setting by firms. We derive the relation between inflation and unemployment under alternative real wage setting rules. We show the nature of the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment stabilization, and we draw the implications for optimal monetary policy."

Investment Options and the Business Cycle,EFCE,2006,"I present an RBC model in which investment options raise the volatility of investment compared to the standard adjustment-cost model. When they are embodied only in new capital, new ideas reduce the value of old capital. Thus when the stock of unimplemented ideas rises, the value of stock market falls, i.e., the stock market and Tobin’s Q are negative indexes of intangibles. In the model, equilibrium is efficient even without markets for knowledge; the stock market suffices."
Liquidity and the Market for Ideas,EFCE,2006,"We study markets where innovators can sell ideas to entrepreneurs, who may be better at implementing them. These markets are decentralized, with random matching and bargaining. Entrepreneurs hold liquid assets lest potentially profitable opportunities may be lost. We extend existing models of the demand for liquidity along several dimensions, including allowing agents to put deals on hold while they try to raise funds. We determine which ideas get traded in equilibrium, compare this to the efficient outcome, and discuss policy implications. We also discuss several special aspects of the market for ideas, as opposed to generic consumption goods, including: they are intermediate inputs; they are indivisible; and they are at least partially public (nonrival) goods."

The Distribution of Wealth and Redistributive Policies,EFCE,2006,"We study the dynamics of the distribution of wealth in an Overlapping Generation economy with bequest and various forms of redistributive taxation. We characterize the transitional dynamics of the wealth distribution as well as the stationary distribution. We show that the stationary wealth distribution is a Pareto distribution whose statistical properties depend on fiscal policies. It can therefore be characterized by a single parameter (if population is constant), which is univocally related to the Gini coefficient of the distribution of wealth. We study analytically the dependence of the distribution of wealth, of wealth inequality in particular, on various redistributive fiscal policy instruments like capital income taxes, estate taxes, and the form and extent of welfare subsidies. Wealth is less concentrated (the Gini coefficient is lower) for both higher capital income taxes and estate taxes, but the marginal effect of capital income taxes is much stronger than the effect of estate taxes. Finally, we characterize optimal redistributive taxes with respect to a utilitarian social welfare measure. Social welfare is maximized  short of minimal wealth inequality and with zero estate taxes."
The Returns to Currency Speculation,EFCE,2006,"Currencies that are at a forward premium tend to depreciate. This 'forward-premium puzzle' represents an egregious deviation from uncovered interest parity. We document the properties of returns to currency speculation strategies that exploit this anomaly. The first strategy, known as the carry trade, is widely used by practitioners. This strategy involves selling currencies forward that are at a forward premium and buying currencies forward that are at a forward discount. The second strategy relies on a particular regression to forecast the payoff to selling currencies forward. We show that these strategies yield high Sharpe ratios which are not a compensation for risk. However, these Sharpe ratios do not represent unexploited profit opportunities. In the presence of microstructure frictions, spot and forward exchange rates move against traders as they increase their positions. The resulting 'price pressure' drives a wedge between average and marginal Sharpe ratios. We argue that marginal Sharpe ratios are zero even though average Sharpe ratios are positive. We display a simple microstructure model that simultaneously rationalizes 'price pressure' and the forward premium puzzle. The central feature of this model is that market makers face an adverse selection problem that is less severe when the currency is expected to appreciate."
"The Young, the Old, and the Restless: Demographics and Business Cycle Volatility",EFCE,2006,
Unemployment Fluctuation with Staggered Nash Wage Bargaining,EFCE,2006,A number of authors have recently emphasized that the conventional model of unemployment dynamics due to Mortensen and Pissarides has difficulty accounting for the relatively volatile behavior of labor market activity over the business cycle. We address this issue by modifying the MP framework to allow for staggered multiperiod wage contracting. What emerges is a tractable relation for wage dynamics that is a natural generalization of the period-by-period Nash bargaining outcome in the conventional formulation. An interesting side-product is the emergence of spillover effects of average wages on the bargaining process. We then show that a reasonable calibration of the model can account well for the cyclical behavior of wages and labor market activity observed in the data. The spillover effects turn out to be important in this respect.
What--Or Who--Caused the Great Depression?,EFCE,2006,
"Agency Conflicts, Investment, and Asset Pricing",EFEL,2006,"Corporations in many countries are run by controlling shareholders whose cash flow rights in the firm are substantially smaller than their control rights. This separation of ownership and control allows the controlling shareholders to pursue private benefits at the cost of minority investors by diverting resources away from the firm and distorting corporate investment and payout policies. We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model to study the asset pricing and welfare implications of imperfect investor protection. The model predicts that countries with weaker investor protection have more incentives to overinvest, lower Tobin’s q, higher return volatility, larger risk premium, and higher interest rate, consistent with existing empirical evidence. We show that weak investor protection causes significant wealth redistribution from outside shareholders to controlling shareholders. Finally, we provide evidence consistent with our model’s two new predictions: countries with higher investment-capital ratios have both larger variance of GDP growth and larger  variance of stock returns."
Bailouts and the Incentive to Manage Risk,EFEL,2006,"In this paper I investigate the incentive effects of bailouts. I present a model in which a firm’s liabilities are implicitly guaranteed by the government. Contrary to common intuition, I show that the ability of the government to withdraw its implicit guarantee constrains the firm’s ability to exploit the freely provided insurance and take risks. The optimal dynamic policy of the firm is to reduce the riskiness of its portfolio when its net worth declines below an endogenously determined threshold. I show that this is the most effective way to induce the government to continue extending its protection. I argue more generally that the model provides a potential rationale for the optimality of existing risk management practices (e.g. Value at Risk) that require institutions to abandon risky investments when their net assets deteriorate."
Bank Risk Taking and Competition Revisied: New Theory and New Evidence,EFEL,2006,"It has been a widely-held belief that more competition is associated with, ceteris paribus, greater instability (more failures) in banking. Yet, the existing empirical evidence is mixed, in part because most existing work has employed either good measures of bank risk or good measures of bank competition, but not both. In this paper we extend two models analyzed in our previous work (Boyd and De Nicolò, Journal of Finance, 2005) by allowing banks to hold bonds in addition to loans, thereby generating implications for both bank risk and asset allocations. The first model is one embedding the “charter value hypothesis” with no loan market (CVH). The second model is our own, with strategic interaction in both loan and deposit markets (BDN). The two models imply opposite relationships between bank concentration and stability. The CVH model implies a positive relationship, indicating a trade-off between competition and stability. The BDN model implies a negative relationship, indicating such a trade-off does not exist. Both models imply an inverse relationship between loan-to-asset ratios and concentration for certain ranges of parameters. We explore these implications empirically using two data sets: a 2003 cross-sectional sample of about 2,500 U.S. banks, and a panel data set with bank-year observations ranging from 13,000 to 18,000 in 134 non-industrialized countries for the period 1993-2004. The results obtained for these two samples are qualitatively identical. We find that a measure of risk monotonically associated with banks’ probability of failure is positively and significantly related to concentration measures. Thus, the risk implications of the CVH model are rejected, those of the BDN model are not. The implications of both models for asset allocations are not rejected, as loan-to-asset ratios are negatively and significantly associated with concentration."
Collateralized Borrowing and Life-Cycle Portfolio Choice,EFEL,2006,"We examine the effects of collateralized borrowing in a realistically parameterized life-cycle portfolio choice problem. We provide basic intuition in a two-period model and then solve a multi-period model computationally. Our analysis provides insights into life-cycle portfolio choice relevant for researchers in macroeconomics and finance. In particular, we show that standard models with unlimited borrowing at the riskless rate dramatically overstate the gains  to holding equity when compared with collateral-constrained models. Our results do not depend on the specification of the collateralized borrowing regime: the gains to trading equity remain relatively small even with the unrealistic assumption of unlimited leverage. We argue that our results strengthen the role of borrowing constraints in explaining the portfolio participation puzzle, that is, why most investors do not own stock."
Does Firm Value Move Too Much to be Justified by Subsequent Changes in Cash Flow?,EFEL,2006,"The appropriate measure of cash flow for valuing corporate assets is net payout, which is the sum of dividends, interest, and net repurchases of equity and debt. Variation in net payout yield, the ratio of net payout to asset value, is mostly driven by movements in expected cash flow growth, rather than by movements in discount rates. Net payout yield is less persistent than the dividend yield and implies much smaller variation in long-horizon discount rates. Therefore, movements in the value of corporate assets can be justified by changes in expected future cash flow."
"Financial Frictions, Investment, and Tobin's q",EFEL,2006,"We develop a model of investment with financial constraints and use it to investigate the relation between investment and Tobin’s q. A firm is financed partly by insiders, who control its assets, and partly by outside investors. When insiders’ wealth is scarce, they earn a rate of return higher than the market rate of return, i.e. insiders earn a quasi-rent on invested capital. This rent is priced into the value of the firm, so Tobin’s q is driven by two forces: changes in the value of invested capital, and changes in the value of the insiders’ future rents. The second effect weakens the correlation between q and investment. We calibrate the model and show that, thanks to this effect, it can generate realistic correlations between investment, q and cash flow."
Heterogeneous Beliefs and Bond Yields,EFEL,2006,"Motivated by the prevalence of heterogeneous beliefs held by market participants regarding future economic fundamentals, we provide an equilibrium model to analyze the effects of belief dispersion on bond yields. Our model shows that the disagreement among agents in regards to their expectations for future interest rates raises bond prices and reduces bond yields relative to the corresponding values in a homogeneous economy, wherein all agents share the wealth weighted average belief. Furthermore, the relative-wealth fluctuation caused by agents’ speculative trading amplifies shocks to the economy and increases yield volatility. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of incorporating belief dispersion into economic analysis of bond yields."
"Intermediation, Capital Immobility, and Asset Prices",EFEL,2006,"We introduce intermediation frictions into a Lucas (1978) asset pricing model in order to study the effects of low capital in the intermediary sector on asset prices. Our model shows that low intermediary capital can increase risk premia, Sharpe ratios, volatility and comovement among intermediated assets. Reductions in intermediary capital also lead to a flight-to-quality in which intermediaries’ investors withdraw their funds and purchase bonds. The model thereby replicates observed asset market behavior during aggregate liquidity crises. In a dynamic context, we show that intermediaries will hedge against periods of low capital, and a liquidity factor driving asset returns arises from such hedging. We calibrate the model to quantify the asset market effects of low intermediary capital."
Is Cash Negative Debt? A Hedging Perspective on Corporate Financial Policies,EFEL,2006,"We model the interplay between cash and debt policies in the presence of financial constraints. While saving cash allows financially constrained firms to hedge future investment against income shortfalls, reducing current debt (saving debt capacity) is a more effective way to boost investment in future high cash flow states. This tradeoff implies that constrained firms will prefer cash to debt capacity if their hedging needs are high (i.e., if the correlation between operating income and investment opportunities is low), but will prefer debt capacity to cash if their hedging needs are low. The empirical examination of cash and debt policies of a large sample of constrained and unconstrained firms reveals evidence that is consistent with our theory. In particular, financially constrained firms with high hedging needs show a strong propensity to save cash out of cash flows, while displaying no propensity to reduce debt. In contrast, constrained firms with low hedging needs systematically channel cash flows towards debt reduction, as opposed to cash savings. Our analysis points to an important hedging motive behind standard financial policies such as cash and debt management. It suggests that cash should not be viewed as negative debt in the presence of financing frictions."

Why Do Portfolios of the Elderly Differ Internationally?,EFEL,2006,"This paper documents international differences in asset holdings among the elderly populations (50+) in the US, UK, and 11 continental European countries, using newly available and internationally comparable household-level data. It then uses econometric techniques to study international variation in the direction of influence, quantitative, and statistical significance of determinants of participation in four categories of assets: stocks (held directly and indirectly), principal residence, private businesses, and real estate other than the primary residence. Effects of the following characteristics are compared across different asset categories and across different countries: education, bequest motives, position in the (non-capital) income and net wealth distribution, self-reported bad health, ability to recall information, and occupational status. The paper also finds significant and asset-specific variation across countries, likely to reflect supply-side differences in asset markets. Finally, the paper documents international differences in levels of asset holdings, using the US as the benchmark, and decomposes observed differences into a part due to differences in configuration of characteristics of asset holder pools, and into another due to differences in influence of household characteristics on these levels."

A Habit-Based Explanation of the Exchange Rate Risk Premium,IFM,2006,"This paper presents a risk premium explanation of the uncovered interest rate parity puzzle. In my two-country model, agents are characterized by slow-moving external habit preferences and they incur proportional and quadratic international trade costs. The precautionary savings effect is assumed to be greater than the inter-temporal consumption-smoothing motive. Thus, times of high risk-aversion correspond to low interest rates. The domestic investor receives a positive exchange rate risk premium when he is effectively more risk-averse than his foreign counterpart. As a result, the domestic investor receives a positive risk premium when interest rates are lower at home than abroad."
A Solution to Two Paradoxes of International Capital Flows,IFM,2006,"International capital flows from rich to poor countries can be regarded as either too small (the Lucas paradox in a one-sector model) or too large (when compared with the logic of factor price equalization in a two-sector model). To resolve the paradoxes, we introduce a non-neo-classical model which features financial contracts and firm heterogeneity. In our model, free trade in goods does not imply equal returns to capital across countries. In addition, rich patterns of gross capital flows emerge as a function of financial and property rights institutions. A poor country with an inefficient financial system may simultaneously experience an outflow of financial capital but an inflow of FDI, resulting in a small netflow. In comparison, a country with a low capital-to-labor ratio but a high risk of expropriation may experience outflow of financial capital without compensating inflow of FDI."
Adjusting to Capital Liberalization,IFM,2006,"We study theoretically how an economy adjusts to liberalization of international financial transaction. We consider an economy in which debtors do not repay unless the debts are secured by collateral, and collateralizable assets for international borrowing are more restricted than domestic borrowing. We examine how the adjustment to capital liberalization depends upon the domestic and international collateral constraints. We show that, with an intermediate level of domestic collateral constraint, capital liberalization leads to capital outflow, improvement of TFP, and transitional loss of wage and employment. Government policy can mitigate the loss of workers at the cost of prolonging the transition, but cannot eliminate the loss without halting the transition."
Capital Flows to Developing Countries: The Allocation Puzzle,IFM,2006,This paper looks at the pattern of capital flows to developing countries over the last 20 years. We show that this pattern is not consistent with the predictions of the textbook neoclassical model of growth. Capital seems to flow upstream: it goes more to the countries that invest less. We argue that this result - which we call the ‘allocation puzzle’ - constitutes and important challenge for economic research.
"Distribution Margins, Imported Inputs, and the Insensitivity of the CPI to Exchange Rates",IFM,2006,"Border prices of traded goods are highly sensitive to exchange rates, but the CPI, and the retail prices of these goods, are more stable. Our paper decomposes the sources of this stability for twenty-one OECD countries, focusing on the important roles of distribution margins and imported inputs in transmitting exchange rate fluctuations into consumption prices. We provide rich cross-country and cross-industry details on distribution margins and their sensitivity to exchange rates, imported inputs used in different categories of consumption goods, and weights in consumption of nontradables, home tradables and imported goods. While distribution margins damp the sensitivity of consumption prices of tradable goods to exchange rates, they also lead to enhanced pass through when nontraded goods prices are sensitive to exchange rates. Such price sensitivity arises because imported inputs are used in production of home nontradables. Calibration exercises show that, at under 5 percent, the United States has the lowest expected CPI sensitivity to exchange rates of all countries examined. On average, calibrated exchange rate pass through into CPIs is expected to be closer to 15 percent."
Does Economic Diversification Lead to Financial Development? Evidence from Topography,IFM,2006,"An influential theoretical literature has observed that economic diversification can reduce risk and increase financial development. But causality operates in both directions. A well functioning financial system can enable a society to invest in more productive but risky projects, thereby determining the degree of economic diversification. Thus, OLS estimates of the impact of economic diversification on financial development are likely to be biased. Motivated by the economic geography literature, this paper uses instruments derived from topographical characteristics to estimate the impact of economic diversification on the development of finance. The IV estimates suggest a large and robust role for diversification in shaping financial development"
Fiscal Policy and Macroeconomic Uncertainty in Developing Countries: The Tale of the Tormented Insurer,IFM,2006,"Governments in developing countries often behave like a ""tormented insurer,"" trying to use non-state-contingent debt instruments to avoid cuts in payments to private agents despite large fluctuations in public revenues. In the data, average public debt-GDP ratios decline as the variability of revenues increases, primary balances and current expenditures follow cyclical patterns sharply at odds with the countercyclical patterns of industrial countries, and the cyclical variability of public expenditures exceeds that of private expenditures by a wide margin. This paper proposes a model of a small open economy with incomplete markets that can rationalize this behavior. In the model, a fiscal authority makes optimal expenditure and debt plans given shocks to output and revenues, and private agents make optimal consumption and asset accumulation plans. Quantitative analysis of the model calibrated to Mexico yields a negative relationship between average public debt and revenue variability similar to the one observed in the data. The model also mimics Mexico’s GDP correlations of government purchases and the primary balance. The ratio of public-to-private expenditures fluctuates widely and the implied welfare costs dwarf conventional estimates of negligible benefits of risk sharing and consumption smoothing."
Information Immobility and the Home Bias Puzzle,IFM,2006,"Many explanations for home or local bias rely on information asymmetry: investors know more about their home assets. A criticism of these theories is that asymmetry should disappear when information is tradable. This criticism is flawed. If investors have asymmetric prior beliefs, but choose how to allocate limited learning capacity before investing, they will not necessarily learn foreign information. Investors want to exploit increasing returns to specialization: The bigger the home information advantage, the more desirable are home assets; but the more home assets investors expect to own, the higher the value of additional home information. Even with a tiny home information advantage, and even when foreign information is no harder to  learn, many investors will specialize in home assets, remain uninformed about foreign assets, and amplify their initial information asymmetry. The model’s predictions are consistent with observed patterns of local and foreign investment."
Sovereign Risk and Secondary Markets,IFM,2006,"The present paper shows that secondary markets can help solve problems of sovereign risk in international financial markets. We study an environment in which agents can trade a complete set of state-contingent securities with other agents, both in the same and in other countries. Governments cannot commit to enforce payments by their residents and payments to foreign residents are never enforced. In the absence of secondary markets, international risk sharing and borrowing are thus impossible. We show that when agents can trade assets ex-post in secondary markets, international risk sharing and borrowing become possible. The mechanism behind our results is that secondary markets tend to transfer securities from those agents who are less likely to be repaid to those agents who are more likely to be repaid. In particular, ex-post agents tend to purchase securities issued by other domestic agents from foreigners. This role of secondary markets in improving enforcement is robust to various extensions of the basic model and is likely to apply to other environments."

Establishing Credibility: Evolving Perceptions of the European Central Bank,ME,2006,"The perceptions of a central bank’s inflation aversion may reflect institutional structure or, more dynamically, the history of its policy decisions. In this paper, we present a novel empirical framework that uses high frequency data to test for persistent variation in market perceptions of central bank inflation aversion. The first years of the European Central Bank (ECB) provide a natural experiment for this model. Tests of the effect of news announcements on the slope of yield curves in the euro-area, and on the euro/dollar exchange rate, suggest that the market’s perception of the policy stance of the ECB during its first six years of operation significantly evolved, with a belief in its inflation aversion increasing in the wake of its monetary tightening. In contrast, tests based on the response of the slope of the United States yield curve to news offer no comparable evidence of any change in market perceptions of the inflation aversion of the Federal Reserve."
Evaluating the Economic Significance of Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity,ME,2006,"This paper formalizes and assesses empirically the implications of widely observed evidence for downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR). First, we formulate and solve an explicit model  of wage-setting in the presence of worker resistance to nominal wage cuts – something that has previously been considered intractable. In particular, we show that this resistance renders wage increases (partially) irreversible. Second, using this model, we can explain why previous estimates of the macroeconomic effects of DNWR have been so weak despite remarkably robust microeconomic evidence. In particular, we show that previous studies have neglected the possibility that DNWR can lead to a compression of wage increases as well as decreases. Thus, the literature may have been overstating the increase in labor costs due to DNWR. Using micro-data for the US and Great Britain, we find robust evidence in support of the predictions of the model. In the light of this evidence, we conclude that increased wage pressure due to DNWR may not be as large as previously envisaged, but that the data is nevertheless consistent with a model in which workers resist nominal wage cuts."
Global Inflation,ME,2006,"This paper shows that inflation in industrialized countries is largely a global phenomenon. First, inflations of (22) OECD countries have a common factor that alone accounts for nearly 70% of their variance. This large variance share that is associated to Global  Inflation is not only due to the trend components of inflation (up from 1960 to 1980 and down thereafter) but also to fluctuations at business cycle frequencies. Second, Global Inflation is, consistently with standard models of inflation, a function of real developments at short horizons and monetary developments at longer horizons. Third, there is a very robust ""error correction mechanism"" that brings national inflation rates back to Global Inflation. This model consistently beats the previous benchmarks used to forecast in ation 1 to 8 quarters ahead across samples and countries."
Heterogeneity in Price Stickiness and the New Keynesian Phillips Curve,ME,2006,"Standard sticky price models do not account for heterogeneity in firms’price setting behavior. However, there is ample evidence that firms differ substantially in the frequency of price adjustments (e.g. Bils and Klenow, 2004 and Dhyne et al., 2005). In this paper I derive a generalized new Keynesian Phillips curve that accounts for heterogeneity in price stickiness across sectors. It differs from the standard one in two important ways: first, the coefficient on the output gap now depends on the distribution of frequencies of price adjustment, and second, it features a new, endogenous shift term that is proportional to a weighted average of the sectoral relative prices. Despite inflation being more sensitive to the output gap in heterogeneous economies than in comparable identical firms economies, the process of adjustment to nominal shocks tends to be more sluggish in the former, owing to the endogenous shift term associated with the distribution of sectoral relative prices. In the presence of strategic complementarities in price setting, the decisions of firms with higher adjustment frequencies are influenced by the existence of firms with lower frequencies, which end up having a disproportionate effect on the aggregate price level. I calibrate the model using an empirical distribution of frequencies of price changes in the U.S. economy derived from Bils and Klenow (2004), and find that reproducing the dynamics of a truly heterogeneous economy with a model based on identical firms usually requires larger degrees of nominal rigidity than the average found in the data.

"Information Shocks, Animal Spirits, and the Meaning of Innovations in Consumer Confidence",ME,2006,"We show that unexplained innovations in several variables representing survey responses to forward-looking questions on the Michigan Survey of Consumers have powerful prognostic implications for the future paths of macroeconomic variables. We attempt to distinguish the hypothesis that these impulse responses indicate a causal channel from autonomous movements in sentiment to economic outcomes (the “animal spirits” view) from the alternative interpretation that the surprise confidence movements summarize information about future economic prospects (the “information” view). In natural rate models, “animal spirits” shocks are associated with “overshooting” of (among other variables) consumption that attenuates when agents come to grips with their overreaction, while “information shocks” about the long future are followed by gradual movements in macroeconomic variables that are not subsequently reversed. In a baseline vector autoregression involving consumption, income, and confidence, the data come down sharply in favor of the information view. The impulse responses of consumption and GDP show no tendency to attenuate even after a number of years. Further, confidence innovations have strong implications for labor productivity many quarters into the future. In somewhat larger VARs with an information block that includes inflation and/or stock prices, the impulse responses to confidence innovations continue to have the permanent shape that defines information shocks, but they are smaller in magnitude. We demonstrate that this is due to the fact that both inflation and stock price innovations have prognostic implications for future productivity that are very similar to the implications of innovations in confidence. Addition of unemployment to the system induces a transitory component that changes the shape of the impulse responses and somewhat weakens the previously airtight case against animal spirits, but it does not provide constructive evidence of such effects."
"Monetary Intervention Mitigated Banking Panics during the Great Depression: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from the Federal Reserve District Border in Mississippi, 1929 to 1933",ME,2006,"The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 divided Mississippi between the 6 th (Atlanta) and 8 (St. Louis) Federal Reserve Districts. Before and during the Great Depression, these districts’ policies differed. The Atlanta Fed championed monetary activism and the extension of aid to ailing institutions. The St. Louis Fed adhered to the doctrine of real bills and eschewed expansionary initiatives. During the banking panic in the fall of 1930, the Atlanta Fed expanded credit available to the financial system and expedited lending to banks in need. The St. Louis Fed did not. Outcomes differed across districts. Banks in the 6 th District survived the panic at a rate substantially higher than banks in the 8 th District. The pattern suggests that monetary intervention reduced failure rates during panics. Historical evidence and statistical analysis corroborates this conclusion."
Read All About It!! What Happens Following a Technology Shock?,ME,2006,"In standard real business cycle models, a large component of the fluctuations is attributed to technology shocks. Unfortunately, empirical evidence examining the role of technology shocks is sparse, in part because they are notoriously difficult to measure. In this paper, I create new indicators of technological change based on books published in the field of technology, and use these indicators to examine what happens to the economy following a technology shock. My findings indicate that, in response to a positive technology shock, employment, total factor productivity and capital all significantly increase. (JEL E32, O3)"
Real Rigidities and Nominal Price Changes,ME,2006,"A large literature seeks to provide microfoundations of price setting for macro models. A challenge has been to develop a model in which monetary policy shocks have the highly persistent effects on real variables estimated by many studies. Nominal price stickiness has proved helpful but not sufficient without some form of “real rigidity” or “strategic complementarity.” We embed a model with a real rigidity a la Kimball (1995), wherein consumers flee from relatively expensive products but do not flock to inexpensive ones. We estimate key model parameters using micro data from the U.S. CPI, which exhibit sizable movements in relative prices of substitute products. When we impose a significant degree of real rigidity, fitting the micro price facts requires very large idiosyncratic shocks and implies large movements in micro quantities."
Sticky Borders,ME,2006,
Sticky Prices and Monetary Policy: Evidence from Disaggregated U.S. Data,ME,2006,"This paper uses factor-augmented vector autoregressions (FAVAR) estimated using a large data set to disentangle fluctuations in disaggregated consumer and producer prices which are due to macroeconomic factors from those due to sectorial conditions. This allows us to provide consistent estimates of the effects of US monetary policy on disaggregated prices. While sectorial prices respond quickly to sector-specific shocks, we find that for a large number of price series, there is a significant delay in the response of prices to monetary policy shocks. In addition, price responses display little evidence of a “price puzzle,” contrary to existing studies based on traditional VARs. The observed dispersion in the reaction of producer prices is relatively well explained by the degree of market power, as predicted by models with monopolistic competition."
The Conquest of South American Inflation,ME,2006,"We use the method of maximum likelihood to infer determinants of Latin American hyperinflations and stabilizations. Our model assigns potential roles both to fundamentals in the form of government deficits that are financed by money creation and to destabilizing expectations dynamics that can occasionally divorce inflation from the fundamentals. Our maximum likelihood estimates allow us to interpret observed inflation rates in terms of shifts in the deficits, sequences of shocks that trigger temporary episodes of expectations driven hyperinflations, and occasional superficial reforms that correct expectations without reforming deficits. Our estimates also allow us to infer from inflation data the fiscal patterns that seem to have stabilized inflation to a low level on a permanent basis."
UK Monetary Regimes and Macroeconomic Stylised Facts,ME,2006,"We exploit the marked changes in U.K. monetary arrangements since the metallic standards era to investigate continuity and changes across monetary regimes in key macroeconomic stylised facts in the United Kingdom. Our main findings may be summarised as follows. (1) Historically, inflation persistence has been the exception, rather than the rule, with inflation estimated to have been highly persistent only during the period between the floating of the pound, in June 1972, and the introduction of inflation targeting, in October 1992. As a corollary, our results clearly reject Mishkin’s (1992) explanation for time-variation in the extent of the Fisher effect, favoring instead Barsky’s (1987) theory. (2) We document a remarkable stability across regimes in the correlation between inflation and the rates of growth of both narrow and broad monetary aggregates at the very low frequencies, thus countering the Whiteman (1984)-McCallum (1984) criticism of Lucas (1980b). (3) The Phillips trade-off was the flattest under the Gold Standard, the steepest between 1972 and 1992. In line with Ball, Mankiw, and Romer (1988), evidence points towards a positive correlation between mean inflation and the steepness of the trade-off. (4) We show how Keynes, in his dispute with Dunlop and Tarshis on real wage cyclicality, was entirely right: during the interwar period, real wages were strikingly counter-cyclical. By contrast, under inflation targeting they have been, so far, strongly pro-cyclical."
Zombie Lending and Depressed Restructuring in Japan,ME,2006,
"Agency Conflicts, Asset Substitution, and Securitization",PERE,2006,"Asset-backed securities represent one of the largest and fastest growing financial markets. Under securitization, agents perform functions (for fees) that would alternatively be performed by a vertically integrated lender with ownership of a whole loan. We examine how outsourcing impacts performance using data on 357 commercial mortgage-backed securities deals with over 46,000 individual loans. To alleviate agency conflicts in managing troubled loans, underwriters often sell the first-loss position to the special servicer, the party who is charged with handling delinquencies and defaults. When holding the first-loss position, special servicers appear to behave more efficiently, making fewer costly transfers of delinquent loans to special servicing, but liquidating a higher percentage of loans that are referred to special servicing. Special servicers are also more likely to own the first loss position in deals that require additional effort (deals with higher delinquencies). Market pricing reflects the existence of agency costs. Despite the apparent reduction of agency costs, the first-loss position is increasingly owned by a party other than the special servicer. We pose a number of explanations, including conflicts between junior and senior securities holders (the asset substitution problem) and risk aversion among special servicers. Consistent with asset substitution, we show that special servicers delay liquidation when they hold the first-loss position in deals with more severe delinquency problems."
"Asset Indivisibility, Security Design, and Asset Quality",PERE,2006,"This paper models and provides empirical evidence for the quality of assets that informed intermediaries sell to bankruptcy remote special purpose vehicles (SPVs) issuing tranched securities to finance the purchase of the assets. The model predicts that indivisible assets sold to SPVs will be of lower quality (“lemons”) compared to assets that are not sold to SPVs. We find strong support for the model’s prediction using a comprehensive data set of sales of mortgage-backed securities (Freddie Mac Participation Certificates, or PCs) to SPVs over the period 1991 through 2002. Furthermore, valuation estimates based on a two-factor structural model indicate that participation certificates sold to SPVs are, on average, valued at least $0.39 lower per $100 of face value relative to PCs not sold to SPVs (about 3-5 basis points in terms of yield-to-maturity). Given the size of these markets, these differences are clearly economically significant."
Does Urban Decay Harm the Poor?,PERE,2006,"Conventional wisdom suggests that urban revitalization can harm the poor, primarily by raising rents. It has also been argued that urban decline harms the poor by reducing job opportunities, the quality of local public services, and other neighborhood amenities. This seeming contradiction can be explained in a model incorporating moving costs and neighborhood quality change sufficiently large to change the rank-ordering of neighborhoods. Data from the American Housing Survey are used to estimate a discrete choice model identifying households’ willingness-to-pay for neighborhood quality, using very basic proxies for quality. These willingness-to-pay estimates are then compared to the actual price changes that accompany observed changes in neighborhood quality. The results suggest that the correlation between neighborhood quality change and price changes is actually quite low, consistent with the theoretical notion that equilibrium price differentials are determined by the household with the least valuation for quality. The results imply that, in general, neighborhood revitalization is more favorable than neighborhood decline."
Housing Cycles,PERE,2006,"Within metropolitan areas, housing prices display high levels of volatility and mean reversion. For example, a five-year increase in prices of $10,000 above the metropolitan area trend is associated with a $3,200 decrease relative to the trend over the next five years. This paper argues that various macroeconomic and financial attempts to understand price dynamics, such using price-to-income ratios or assessing prices as the net present value of rents, are generally flawed both conceptually and empirically. Instead, we put forward a dynamic version of an Alonso-Rosen spatial equilibrium model where house prices reflect the willingness to pay for the wages of different metropolitan areas. A calibration of this model suggests that it can do well at explaining mean reversion and the relationship between prices and incomes, but less well at explaining the high variance of housing price changes, particularly within high cost areas. This failure might either be the result of underestimating the true year-to-year variation in relevant local economic conditions or the result of unobserved factors driving the willingness to pay for housing in different areas."
How Elastic is Residential Capital Investment to Property Taxation? Evidence from Court-Induced Tax Changes,PERE,2006,"The property tax is the most significant local tax in the U.S. This study assesses the impact of property taxation on residential capital investment decisions using a unique school finance reform in the state of New Hampshire which produced large changes in property tax rates across the state. The estimates suggest that the community receiving the typical fiscal shock, equal to fifteen percent of the community’s total pre-reform tax revenue, experienced an increase in residential construction of approximately sixteen percent. A series of robustness checks and falsification tests provide assurance that the estimates reflect the causal response to the fiscal shock. There is significant geographic heterogeneity in the response. The housing market cleared the shock through a quantity (i.e. investment) adjustment in most of the state and a price (i.e. capitalization) adjustment in the suburban ring near Boston. The differing response is attributed to differing housing supply elasticities. The paper’s findings have relevance for the analysis of policies, such as school finance reform, which induce changes in rates of property taxation across communities. The findings are also relevant to the theoretical debate over the incidence of the property tax and the large literature on the capitalization of local amenities."

There Goes the Neighborhood? Estimates of the Impact of Crime Risk on Property Values from Megan's Laws,PERE,2006,
Volunteering to be Taxed: Business Improvement Districts and the Extra-Governmental Provision of Public Safety,PERE,2006,"When the median voter's preference sets the level of local public goods, some voters are left unsatisfied. Is there an institution by which subsets of voters can resolve the collective action problem and increase the local provision of public goods? If so, what are the consequences? In response to problems such as crime and vandalism, neighborhood property owners have established Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) to provide local public goods. When a BID is approved by a majority of property owners in a neighborhood, state law makes contributions to the BID budget mandatory. This resolution of the neighborhood's collective action problem reduces crime – BIDs in the city of Los Angeles are robustly associated with crime declines of 5 to 9 percent. Indeed, crime falls regardless of estimation technique: fixed effects; comparing BIDs to neighborhoods that considered, but did not adopt, BIDs; using propensity score matching; and comparing BIDs to their neighbors. Strikingly, these declines are purchased cheaply. Attributing all BID expenditure to violent crime reduction, and thus ignoring the impact of BID expenditure on many quality-of-life crimes, BIDs spend $21,000 to avert one violent crime. This higher bound estimate is substantially lower than the $57,000 social cost of a violent crime."
"Voting, Opportunity Costs, and Property Taxes",PERE,2006,"Owners of real estate owe property taxes to local governments, but only permanent residents are granted the right to vote. The presence non-voting property owners reduces the share of total property tax revenue remitted by resident voters, thereby lowering residents’ opportunity costs of public expenditure. Minnesota data suggest that spending on municipal services is higher as a result of the lower opportunity costs: communities with high concentrations of property value owned by non-voters spend more per resident than other communities. These results suggest that a one percent decrease in opportunity costs for voters is associated with at least a 0.50% increase in per capita property tax revenue. A policy innovation in 2001 affords the opportunity to further identify the effect on property taxes by comparing revenues before and after the change. These results suggest that a one percent increase in voter tax share is associated with a 1% decrease in per capita property tax revenue, a reduction of approximately $20 per capita at the mean."
An Empirical Analysis of the Pricing of Collateralized Debt Obligations,RISK,2006,"We study the pricing of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) using an extensive new data set for the actively-traded CDX credit index and its tranches. We find that a three-factor portfolio credit model allowing for firm-specific, industry, and economywide default events explains virtually all of the time-series and cross-sectional variation in CDX index tranche prices. These tranches are priced as if losses of 0.4, 6, and 35 percent of the portfolio occur with expected frequencies of 1.2, 41.5, and 763 years, respectively. On average, 65 percent of the CDX spread is due to firm-specific default risk, 27 percent to clustered industry or sector default risk, and 8 percent to catastrophic or systemic default risk. Recently, however, firm-specific default risk has begun to play a larger role."
Asset Prices When Agents are Marked to Market,RISK,2006,"""Risk management"" in securities markets refers to the oversight of portfolio managers and professional traders when they trade on behalf of investors in security markets. Monitoring of their trading performance is usually based on ""marking-to-market"", that is, the agents' performance, profit and loss, and risk-taking behavior, is measured by principals using market security prices. We study the optimality of the practice of marking-to-market and provide conditions under which investing principials should optimally monitor their agent traders using market prices to measure the traders' performance. Asset prices, however, can be affected by mark-to-market contracts. We show that such contracts introduce an externality when there are many traders. Traders may rationally herd, trading on irrelevant information. Ironincally, this causes asset prices to be less informative than they would be without mark-to-market contracts."
Frailty Correlated Default,RISK,2006,"We analyze portfolio credit risk in light of dynamic “frailty,” in the form of incompletely observed default. Common dependence by firms on unobservable time-varying default covariates is estimated to cause large changes in conditional mean default rates above and beyond those predicted by observable factors, and large increases in the fatness of the tails of the distributions of portfolio default losses for U.S. corporates. We also allow for unobserved heterogeneity aross firms."
Carry Trades and Speculative Dynamics,AP,2007,"We develop a model of foreign exchange trading with imperfect liquidity. Speculators have a collective impact on market liquidity. Moreover, their margin requirements decrease with market liquidity. Such circumstances can turn carry trades into self-enforcing arbitrage opportunities: Carry trades generate all the more value because many speculators enter them. As a result, rational speculation destabilizes the exchange rate. Applying recent advances in dynamic coordination games, we obtain a unique equilibrium exchange rate with high conditional skewness. Namely, extended periods of slow depreciation of the low rate currency are followed by abrupt reversals. Reversals are stochastic, but their distribution is uniquely determined by the distribution of the fundamentals."
Economic Catastrophe Bonds,AP,2007,"The central insight of asset pricing is that a security’s value depends on both its distribution of payoffs across economic states and state prices. In fixed income markets, many investors focus exclusively on estimates of expected payoffs, such as credit ratings, without considering the state of the economy in which default is likely to occur. Such investors are likely to be attracted to securities whose payoffs resemble those of economic catastrophe bonds–bonds that default only under severe economic conditions. We show that many structured finance instruments can be characterized as economic catastrophe bonds, but offer far less compensation than alternatives with comparable payoff profiles. We argue that this difference arises from the willingness of rating agencies to certify structured products with a low default likelihood as “safe” and from a large supply of investors who view them as such."
Expected Stock Returns and Variance Risk Premia,AP,2007,"We find that the difference between implied and realized variation, or the variance risk premium, is able to explain more than fifteen percent of the ex-post time series variation in quarterly excess returns on the market portfolio over the 1990 to 2005 sample period, with high (low) premia predicting high (low) future returns. The magnitude of the return predictability of the variance risk premium easily dominates that afforded by standard predictor variables like the P/E ratio, the dividend yield, the default spread, and the consumption-wealth ratio (CAY). Moreover, combining the variance risk premium with the P/E ratio results in an R 2 for the quarterly returns of more than twenty-five percent. The results depend crucially on the use of “model-free”, as opposed to standard Black-Scholes, implied variances, and realized variances constructed from high-frequency intraday, as opposed to daily, data. Our findings suggest that temporal variation in both risk-aversion and volatility-risk play an important role in determining stock market returns."
Long-Run Risk through Consumption Smoothing,AP,2007,"We show that a standard production economy model where consumers have Epstein-Zin preferences can jointly explain the low volatility of consumption growth and a high market price of risk with a low coefficient of relative risk aversion (five). Endogenous consumption smoothing increases the price of risk in this economy as it induces highly persistent time-variation in expected aggregate consumption growth (long-run risk), even when technology growth is i.i.d. The model identifies an observable proxy for otherwise hard to measure expected consumption growth. Using this proxy, we test and find support for key predictions of the model in the time series of consumption growth and the cross-section of stock returns."
Long-term and short-term market betas in securities prices,AP,2007,"The market-beta computed from stock returns that are aged from 1 year to 10 years has a significant positive influence in explaining the cross-section of future stock returns. The market-beta computed from stock returns over the most recent 12 months has a significant negative influence. The change in beta is therefore even more significant, and the effect is as strong as—and independent of—the effects of the Fama-French factors. Previous research failed to find that market-beta matters, primarily because ordinary market-betas combine these two opposing forces and because betas based on monthly stock returns are too weak. Our results are stronger in recent years and when we control for Fama-French and momentum factors. Remarkably, perhaps the best explanation for our findings is one in which the short-term beta proxies for exposure to a novel factor, and the long-term beta captures the standard hedging motive."
Mortgage Timing,AP,2007,"The fraction of newly-originated mortgages that are of the adjustable-rate (ARM) versus the fixed-rate (FRM) type exhibits a surprising amount of time variation. A simple utility framework of mortgage choice points to the bond risk premium as theoretical determinant: when the bond risk premium is high, FRM payments are high, making ARMs more attractive. We confirm empirically that the bulk of the time variation in household mortgage choice can be explained by time variation in the bond risk premium. This is true regardless of whether bond risk premia are measured using forecasters’ data, using a VAR term structure model, or using a simple rule-of-thumb based on adaptive expectations. This simple rule-of-thumb moves in lock-step with mortgage choice, thereby lending further credibility to a theory of strategic mortgage timing by households."
The Small World of Investing: Board Connections and Mutual Fund Returns,AP,2007,"This paper uses social networks to identify information transfer in security markets. We focus on connections between mutual fund managers and corporate board members via shared education networks. We find that portfolio managers place larger bets on firms they are connected to through their network, and perform significantly better on these holdings relative to their non-connected holdings. A replicating portfolio of connected stocks outperforms a replicating portfolio of non-connected stocks by up to 8.4% per year. Returns are concentrated around corporate news announcements, consistent with mutual fund managers gaining an informational advantage through the education networks. Our results suggest that social networks may be an important mechanism for information flow into asset prices."
Understanding Index Option Returns,AP,2007,"This paper studies the returns from investing in index options. Previous research documents significant average option returns, large CAPM alphas, and high Sharpe ratios, and concludes that put options are mispriced. We propose an alternative approach to evaluate the significance of option returns and obtain different conclusions. Instead of using these statistical metrics, we compare historical option returns to those generated by commonly used option pricing models. We find that the most puzzling finding in the existing literature, the large returns to writing out-of-the-money puts, is not even inconsistent with the Black-Scholes model. Moreover, simple stochastic volatility models with no risk premia generate put returns across all strikes that are not inconsistent with the observed data. At-the-money straddle returns are more challenging to understand, and we find that these returns are not inconsistent with explanations such as jump risk premia, Peso problems, and estimation risk."
"Young, Old, Conservative and Bold: The Implications of Heterogeneity and Finite Lives for Asset Pricing",AP,2007,"We present a general equilibrium model featuring a continuum of overlapping generations, as in Blanchard (1985). In addition, we assume that agents have standard utilities exhibiting constant relative risk aversion and can be born with differing risk aversions, discount factors, and inclinations to work. Once we aggregate, we find that equilibrium asset prices are determined as if the economy was populated by a single representative agent with time varying risk aversion that follows a stationary process. Because of this, our model is observationally similar to the model of Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and is therefore successful at addressing a number of stylized facts about asset prices. The time variation in the risk aversion of the representative agent arises endogenously as a result of aggregating standard life cycle consumption and portfolio choice problems."
A Calibratable Model of Optimal CEO Incentives in Market Equilibrium,CF,2007,"This paper presents a tractable, neoclassical model of both CEO incentives and total pay in market equilibrium. We embed the traditional principal-agent framework into a competitive assignment model, where managerial talent determines total wages and the size of one’s firm. This generates quantitative predictions for the optimal level of CEO incentives and their scaling with firm size. We empirically evaluate the model and show that observed practices are close to our first-best benchmark. In particular, the significant negative relationship between the CEO’s effective equity stake and firm size is fully consistent with optimal contracting, and need not reflect rent extraction. While various measures of wealth-performance sensitivity have been used by empiricists, our model proposes that the most appropriate measure is the dollar change in wealth for a percentage change in firm value, scaled by annual pay. Both theory and evidence show that it is independent of firm size, in contrast to alternative measures, and thus comparable between firms and over time. "
Capital Allocation,CF,2007,"This paper investigates procedures for allocating capital in banks and other financial institutions. Capital should be allocated in proportion to the marginal default value of each line of business, where marginal default value is the derivative of the value of the bank’s default put with respect to a change in the scale of the business. Marginal default values give a unique allocation that adds up exactly. Marginal default values depend in part on capital allocations. Cross subsidies are avoided if capital allocations are set so that capital-adjusted marginal default values are the same for all lines. Each line’s capital allocation should depend on the value of the line’s payoffs in default. We include a series of examples showing how our procedures work and we sketch how the procedures would be applied in practice."

Has New York Become Less Competitive in Global Markets?: Evaluating Foreign Listing Changes Over Time,CF,2007,"We study the determinants and consequences of cross-listings on the New York and London stock exchanges from 1990 to 2005. This investigation enables us to evaluate the relative benefits of New York and London exchange listings and to assess whether these relative benefits have changed over time, perhaps as a result of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of Congress (SOX) in 2002. We find that cross-listings have been falling on U.S. exchanges as well as on the Main Market in London. This decline in cross-listings is explained by changes in firm characteristics rather than by changes in the benefits of cross-listing. We show that, after controlling for firm characteristics, there is no deficit in cross-listing counts on U.S. exchanges related to SOX. Investigating the valuation differential between listed and non-listed firms (the “cross-listing premium”) from 1990 to 2005, we find that there is a significant premium for U.S. exchange listings every year, that the premium has not fallen significantly in recent years, that it  persists when allowing for unobservable firm characteristics, and that there is a permanent premium in event time. In contrast, there is no premium for listings on London’s Main Market for any year. Cross-listing in the U.S. leads firms to increase their capital-raising activity at home and abroad while a London listing has no such impact. Our evidence is consistent with the theory that an exchange listing in New York has unique governance benefits for foreign firms. These benefits have not been seriously eroded by SOX and cannot be replicated through a London listing."
"Hold-up, Asset Ownership, and Reference Points",CF,2007,"We study the trade-off between contractual flexibility and rigidity. Two parties can write a flexible contract that adjusts price to circumstances or a rigid contract that fixes price. A flexible contract leads to argument and shading. A rigid contract gives one party an incentive to hold up the other if value or cost falls outside the normal range. An optimal contract trades off shading and hold-up costs. Asset ownership can help. If one party owns a key asset, his outside option will be high when his value from trade is high. This reduces both shading and hold-up costs."
Institutional Stock Trading on Loan Market Information,CF,2007,"Over the past decade, one of the most important developments in the corporate loan market has been the increasing participation of institutional investors in lending syndicates. As lenders, institutional investors routinely receive private information about borrowers. However, most of these investors also trade in public securities. This leads to a controversial question: do institutional investors use private information received in the loan market to trade in public securities? In this paper we examine the stock trading of institutional investors that also hold loans in their portfolio. Specifically, we look at the abnormal returns on stock trades following loan renegotiations. By collecting SEC filings of loan amendments, we are able to identify institutional investors that had access to private information disclosed by the borrower during loan renegotiations. Our results indicate that institutional managers that participate in loan renegotiations consequently trade in stock of the same company and outperform other managers by approximately 8.8% in annualized terms in the month following loan renegotiation."
Operating Under a Liquidity Crunch: The Impact of LBOs on Product Availability in the Supermarket Industry,CF,2007,
Real and Financial Industry Booms and Busts,CF,2007,"We examine how industry valuation and product market competition affect firm cash flows and stock returns. In competitive industries we find that operating cash flows and stock returns decrease with industry-level stock-market valuation, investment and new financing. We find weak and generally insignificant results in concentrated industries. In competitive industries, firms in the most highly valued industry quintile have abnormal stock returns that are four percentage points lower than those in the least valuable industry quintile. Overall our results are consistent with a small probability of a new era of very high subsequent growth, or high competition among firms that affects both industry cash flows and stock prices in competitive industries."
The Bank as Grim Reaper: Debt Composition and Recoveries of Defaulted Debt,CF,2007,
The Cost of Debt,CF,2007,"We use panel data from 1980 to 2005 to estimate cost functions for corporate debt. We start with Graham’s (2000) debt benefit curves and assume that for financially unconstrained firms, the benefit curve and the cost curve intersect at the actual level of debt, on average. Using this equilibrium condition, exogenous shifts of the benefit curves enable us to identify the marginal cost curve. We recover marginal cost functions that are positively sloped and provide coefficients that can be used to determine the marginal cost of debt. By integrating the area between the benefit and cost functions we estimate that the net benefit of debt equals about 4% of asset value. Our findings are consistent over time, across industries, and when accounting for fixed adjustment costs of debt. We show that both the intercept and the slope of the marginal cost curve of debt depend on firm characteristics such as asset collateral, book-to-market ratio, sales, cash flows, cash holdings, and whether the firm pays dividends. As such, our framework provides a new parsimonious environment within which we can examine implications from competing capital structure theories. Our approach also allows us to make recommendations about firm-specific optimal debt ratios and estimate the cost of being under or overlevered."
The Economics of Private Equity Funds,CF,2007,"This paper analyzes the economics of the private equity industry using a novel model and dataset. We obtain data from a large investor in private equity funds, with detailed records on 238 funds raised between 1992 and 2006. Fund managers earn revenue from a variety of fees and profit-sharing rules. We build a model to estimate the expected revenue to managers as a function of these rules, and we test how this estimated revenue varies across the characteristics of our sample funds. Among our sample funds, about 60 percent of expected revenue comes from management fees, a fixed-revenue component that is not sensitive to performance. We find major differences between venture capital (VC) funds and buyout (BO) funds – the two main sectors of the private equity industry. In general, BO fund managers earn lower revenue per managed dollar than do managers of VC funds, but nevertheless these BO managers earn substantially higher revenue per partner and per professional than do VC managers. Furthermore, BO managers build on their prior experience by raising larger funds, which leads to significantly higher revenue per partner and per professional, despite the fact that these larger funds have lower revenue per dollar. Conversely, while prior experience by VC managers does lead to higher revenue per partner in later funds, it does not lead to higher revenue per professional. Taken together, these results suggest that the BO business is more scalable than the VC business."
The Effects of Financial Conditions on Capital Investment and Financing: Evidence from Variation in Pension Fund Asset Performance,CF,2007,"This paper examines the effects of changes in a firm’s financial condition on capital expenditures, as well as on the costs of raising external finance. Changes in pension fund asset values are largely reflected in the market value of the sponsor’s equity, and can be fully incorporated into pension-adjusted measures of book equity. The condition of the firm’s balance sheet, as measured by book and market leverage, has a statistically robust effect on capital investment, even when the variation in leverage is due strictly to pension fund asset performance. I provide evidence that variation in pension fund asset performance is unlikely to be correlated with the sponsor’s investment opportunities, especially within industries and in the presence of nonlinear profitability controls. Credit rating agencies are more likely to upgrade firms when the pension assets perform well and downgrade them when the pension assets perform poorly. Overall the evidence highlights the impact of borrowers’ net worth on the costs of external capital and is consistent with models of underinvestment in the presence of financial constraints. However, the magnitude of the effects is small relative to the within-firm standard deviation of capital expenditures."
When are Outside Directors Effective,CF,2007,"Theory suggests that the effectiveness of outside directors depends on how informed they are about the firm. Well-informed outside directors can monitor insiders and help control agency problems, but poorly informed directors may push the firm down unprofitable paths. This paper documents that the effect of outside directors on firm performance depends on their cost of acquiring information: outside directors improve performance when the information cost is low and reduce performance when the information cost is high. We address the standard endogeneity problem between performance and board composition by focusing on firms that were required to increase the number of outsider directors as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory changes. We also document that firms compose their boards as if they understand that outsider effectiveness varies with information costs, though less so in recent years due to compliance pressures."

"A Simple, Unified, Exactly Solved Framework for Ten Puzzles in Macro-Finance",EFCE,2007,"This paper works out a simple unified framework for a series of puzzles in macro-finance. It builds on the Rietz-Barro view, that a small probability of large crises or disasters generates is what generates risk premia in asset markets. During a disaster, an asset’s fundamental value will fall by a time-varying amount. This time-varying amount generates time-varying risk premia, hence volatile asset prices, and partial predictability of future asset returns. Using the recent technique of linearity-generating processes (Gabaix 2007), the model is very tractable, and all prices are in closed form. Hence, the paper presents a simple, exactly solved, frictionless benchmark for a series of questions on asset prices. It provides a way to think about the following puzzles: (i) equity premium puzzle (ii) risk-free rate-puzzle (iii) excess volatility puzzle (the fact that equity prices are so volatile) (iv) value-growth puzzle (stocks with high price-dividend ratios have low future returns) (v) upward sloping nominal yield curve (vi) Fama-Bliss findings that a higher slope of the yield curve predicts higher risk premia on bond returns (vii) corporate bond spread puzzle (the spread between corporate and government bond rates are higher than warranted by the U.S. historical experience) (viii) characteristics vs covariance puzzles (simple numbers such as the price-dividend ratio of stocks predict future returns better that covariances with economic factors) (ix) partial predictability of aggregate stock market returns by price/dividend and consumption/wealth ratios (x) high price of deep out-of-the-money puts. The “probability of disaster”can be interpreted literally, or could simply model varying risk, risk aversion, or investor sentiment in a particularly tractable way."
Americans Do I.T. Better: US Multinationals and the Productivity Miracle,EFCE,2007,"The US has experienced a sustained increase in productivity growth since the mid-1990s, particularly in sectors that intensively use information technologies (IT). This has not occurred in Europe. If the US ""productivity miracle"" is due to a natural advantage of being located in the US then we would not expect to see any evidence of it for US establishments located abroad. This paper shows in fact that US multinationals operating in the UK do have higher productivity than non-US multinationals in the UK, and this is primarily due to the higher productivity of their IT. Furthermore, establishments that are taken over by US multinationals increase the productivity of their IT, whereas observationally identical establishments taken over by non-US multinationals do not. One explanation for these patterns is that US firms are organized in a way that allows them to use new technologies more efficiently. A model of endogenously chosen organizational form and IT is developed to explain these new micro and macro findings."

Bubbles in Prices of Exhaustible Resources,EFCE,2007,"Aside from the equilibrium that Hotelling (1931) displayed, his model of non-renewable resources also contains a continuum of bubble equilibria. In all the equilibria the price of the resource rises at the rate of interest. In a bubble equilibrium, however, the consumption of the resource peters out, and a positive fraction of the original stock continues to be traded forever. And that may well be happening in the market for some top-vintage Bordeaux wines."

Minimally Altruistic Wages and Unemployment in a Matching Model,EFCE,2007,"This paper presents a model in which firms recruit both unemployed and employed workers by posting vacancies. Firms act monopsonistically and set wages to retain their existing workers as well as to attract new ones. The model differs from Burdett and Mortensen (1998) in that its assumptions ensure that there is an equilibrium where all firms pay the same wage. The paper analyzes the response of this wage to exogenous changes in the marginal revenue product of labor. The paper finds parameters for which the response of wages is modest relative to the response of employment, as appears to be the case in U.S. data and shows that the insistence by workers that firms act with a minimal level of altruism can be a source of dampened wage responses. The paper also considers a setting where this minimal level of altruism is subject to fluctuations and shows that, for certain parameters, the model can explain both the standard deviations of employment and wages and the correlation between these two series over time."
On the Sources of the Great Moderation,EFCE,2007,"The remarkable decline in macroeconomic volatility experienced by the U.S. economy since the mid-80s (the so-called Great Moderation) has been accompanied by large changes in the patterns of comovements among output, hours and labor productivity. Those changes are reflected in both conditional and unconditional second moments as well as in the impulse responses to identified shocks. That evidence points to structural change, as opposed to just good luck, as an explanation for the Great Moderation. We use a simple macro model to suggest some of the immediate sources which are likely to be behind the observed changes."

The Role of Debt and Equity Finance over the Business Cycle,EFCE,2007,"This paper documents that debt and equity issuance are procyclical for most size-sorted firm categories of listed U.S. firms. The procyclicality of equity issuance decreases monotonically with firm size. At the aggregate level, however, the results are not conclusive. The reason is that issuance is countercyclical for very large firms which, although few in number, have a large effect on the aggregate because of their enormous size. We show that the shadow price of external funds is procyclical if firms use the standard one-period contract. This model property generates procyclical equity and— as in the data— the procyclicality decreases with firm size. Another factor that causes equity to be procyclical in the model is a countercyclical cost of equity issuance. The calibrated model (i) generates a countercyclical default rate, (ii) generates a stronger cyclical response for small firms, and (iii) magnifies shocks, whereas the model without equity as an external financing source does the exact opposite."
"A Simple, Unified, Exactly Solved Framework for Ten Puzzles in Macro-Finance",EFEL,2007,"This paper works out a simple unified framework for a series of puzzles in macro-finance. It builds on the Rietz-Barro view, that a small probability of large crises or disasters generates is what generates risk premia in asset markets. During a disaster, an asset’s fundamental value will fall by a time-varying amount. This time-varying amount generates time-varying risk premia, hence volatile asset prices, and partial predictability of future asset returns. Using the recent technique of linearity-generating processes (Gabaix 2007), the model is very tractable, and all prices are in closed form. Hence, the paper presents a simple, exactly solved, frictionless benchmark for a series of questions on asset prices. It provides a way to think about the following puzzles: (i) equity premium puzzle (ii) risk-free rate-puzzle (iii) excess volatility puzzle (the fact that equity prices are so volatile) (iv) value-growth puzzle (stocks with high price-dividend ratios have low future returns) (v) upward sloping nominal yield curve (vi) Fama-Bliss findings that a higher slope of the yield curve predicts higher risk premia on bond returns (vii) corporate bond spread puzzle (the spread between corporate and government bond rates are higher than warranted by the U.S. historical experience) (viii) characteristics vs covariance puzzles (simple numbers such as the price-dividend ratio of stocks predict future returns better that covariances with economic factors) (ix) partial predictability of aggregate stock market returns by price/dividend and consumption/wealth ratios (x) high price of deep out-of-the-money puts. The “probability of disaster”can be interpreted literally, or could simply model varying risk, risk aversion, or investor sentiment in a particularly tractable way."
Do Households Benefit from Financial Deregulation and Innovation? The Case of the Mortgage Market,EFEL,2007,
Durability of Output and Expected Stock Returns,EFEL,2007,"The demand for durable goods is more cyclical than that for nondurable goods and services. Consequently, the cash flow and stock returns of durable-good producers are exposed to higher systematic risk. Using the NIPA input-output tables, we construct portfolios of durable-good, nondurable-good, and service producers. In the cross-section, a strategy that is long on durables and short on services earns a sizable risk premium. In the time series, a strategy that is long on durables and short on the market portfolio earns a countercyclical risk premium. We develop an equilibrium asset-pricing model that explains these empirical findings."
Financial Policy with Fully Rational Firms,EFEL,2007,"This paper studies a model of firm financing where the firm cares about maximizing cash flows and smoothing dividend payments. Every period, firms decide how much to invest, how many stocks to issue and how many dividends to pay. In contrast to the existing literature, we assume that the firm is fully rational, in the sense that it recognizes the relationship between future dividends and stock prices. Under this assumption, the problem of the firm is of similar nature to a problem of optimal fiscal policy, since it chooses today’s dividend and it makes promises to the market stockholders about future dividends that induce them to hold the stock. Financial policy may therefore be time inconsistent. First, we characterize several special cases where time consistency arises. Second, we study the full commitment (and time inconsistent) solution numerically in a setup with capital accumulation and incomplete financial markets. The fully rational policy is also compared to the case where the firm is naive, in the sense that it does not take into account the relationship between future dividends and prices. Our results suggest that growing firms that are fully rational will pay lower dividends at the beginning and promise higher dividends in the future to inflate the stock price. This allows them to raise cheaper external funds and grow faster."
Incentives for Information Production in Markets where Prices Affect Real Investment,EFEL,2007,"A fundamental role of financial markets is to gather information on firms’ investment opportunities, and so help guide investment decisions. In this paper we study the incentives for information production when prices perform this allocational role. If firms cancel planned investments following poor stock market response, the value of their shares will become insensitive to information on investment opportunities, so that speculators will be deterred from producing information ex ante. Based on this insight, we derive several new results on the determinants of information production and the resulting firm value and investment policy. We show that information production on investment opportunities is distinctly different than that on assets in place, and argue that some overinvestment increases firm value."
Information Sharing and Credit: Firm-Level Evidence from Transition Countries,EFEL,2007,"We investigate whether information sharing among banks has affected credit market performance in the transition countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, using a large sample of firm-level data. Our estimates show that information sharing is associated with improved availability and lower cost of credit to firms, and that this correlation is  stronger for opaque firms than transparent firms. In cross-sectional estimates, we control for variation in country-level aggregate variables that may affect credit, by examining the differential impact of information sharing across firm types. In panel estimates, we also control for the presence of unobserved heterogeneity at the firm level and for changes in selected macroeconomic variables."
Investment and the Cost of Capital: New Evidence from the Corporate Bond Market,EFEL,2007,
"Investor Protection, Risk-sharing and Inequality",EFEL,2007,"This paper studies the relationship between investor protection, Financial risk sharing and income inequality. In the presence of market frictions, better protection makes investors more willing to take on entrepreneurial risk while lending to firms. This implies lower cost of external finance and better risk sharing between financiers and entrepreneurs. Investor protection, by boosting the market for risk sharing plays the twofold role of encouraging agents to undertake risky enterprises and providing them with insurance. By increasing the number of risky projects, it raises income inequality. By extending insurance to more agents, it reduces it. As a result, the relationship between the size of the market for risk sharing and income inequality is hump-shaped. Empirical evidence from a cross-section of sixty-eight countries, and a panel of fifty countries over the period 1976-2000, supports the predictions of the model."
Optimal Inattention to the Stock Market,EFEL,2007,"Recurrent intervals of inattention to the stock market are optimal if it is costly to observe the value of the stock market. At times that consumers observe the value of the stock market, they decide whether to transfer funds between a transactions account from which consumption must be financed and an investment portfolio of equity and riskless bonds. Any transfers of funds are subject to a proportional transactions cost, so the consumer may choose not to transfer any funds on a particular observation date. In general, the optimal adjustment rule–including the size and direction of transfers, and the time of the next observation–is state-dependent. Surprisingly, we find that eventually the consumer’s optimal behavior evolves to a situation with a purely time-dependent rule, with a constant interval of time between observations. This interval of time can be substantial even with tiny observation costs."
Payoff Complementarities and Financial Fragility: Evidence from Mutual Fund Outflows,EFEL,2007,"It is often argued that strategic complementarities generate financial fragility. Finding empirical evidence, however, has been a challenge. We derive empirical implications from a global-game model and test them using data on mutual fund outflows. Consistent with the theory, we find that conditional on low past performance, funds with illiquid assets (where complementarities are stronger) are subject to more outflows than funds with liquid assets. Moreover, this pattern disappears in funds that are held primarily by large/institutional investors (who can internalize the externalities). We provide evidence that are inconsistent with the alternative explanations based on information conveyed by past performance or on clientele effects."

Winners and Losers in Housing Markets,EFEL,2007,"This paper is a quantitatively-oriented theoretical study into the interaction between housing prices, aggregate production, and household behavior over a lifetime. We develop an overlapping generations model of a production economy in which land and capital are combined into residential and commercial structures. We find that, in the economy where land is more important for structures, households face a higher house price-rental ratio and tend to buy houses later in life in the steady state. Moreover, the housing price reacts more to an exogenous change in fundamentals, causing a larger redistribution effect between net buyers and net sellers of houses."

A Framework for identifying the Sources of Local-Currency Price Stability with an Empirical Application,IFM,2007,"The inertia of the local-currency prices of traded goods in the face of exchange-rate changes is a well-documented phenomenon in International Economics. This paper develops a framework for identifying the sources of local-currency price stability. The empirical approach exploits manufacturers' and retailers' first-order conditions in conjunction with detailed information on the frequency of price adjustments in response to exchange-rate changes, in order to quantify the relative importance of fixed costs of repricing, local-cost non-traded components, and markup adjustment by manufacturers and retailers in the incomplete transmission of exchange-rate changes to prices. The approach is applied to micro data from the beer market. We find that: (a) wholesale prices appear more rigid than retail prices; (b) price adjustment costs account on average for up to 0.5% of revenue at the wholesale level, but only 0.1% of revenue at the retail level; (c) overall, 54.1% of the incomplete exchange rate pass-through is due to local non-traded costs; 33.7% to markup adjustment; and 12.2% to the existence of price adjustment costs."
Can Heterogeneity in Price Stickiness Account for the Dispersion in the Law of One Price Deviations?,IFM,2007,"The classic explanation for the persistence and volatility of real exchange rates is that they are the result of nominal shocks in an economy with sticky goods prices. A key implication of this explanation is that if goods have differing degrees of price stickiness then relatively more sticky goods tend to have relatively more persistent and volatile good-level real exchange rates. Using panel data, we find only modest support for these key implications. The predictions of the theory for persistence have some modest support: in the data, the stickier is the price of a good the more  persistent is its real exchange rate, but the theory predicts much more variation in persistence than is in the data. The predictions of the theory for volatiity fare less well: in the data, the stickier is the price of a good the smaller is its conditional variance while in the theory the opposite holds. We show that allowing for pricing complementarities leads to a modest improvement in the theory’s predictions for persistence but little improvement in the theory’s predictions for conditional variances."
Fire-Sale FDI,IFM,2007,"Capital flight associated with the onset of a financial crisis in a country is often accompanied by an inflow of capital associated with foreign direct investment (FDI). Our paper provides a theoretical framework for this puzzle, and draws wider conclusions on the welfare effects of foreign takeovers. When fundamentals deteriorate, the return that can be pledged to portfolio investors is limited by the incentive constraints of the managers. Only with direct control by investors can the surplus in the project be unlocked. It is precisely during crises that there is the conjunction of the loss of control by incumbent domestic managers, and the lack of domestic capital to take over failing firms. Foreign investors can take over failing firms and capture the surplus, even though they value the assets less. Our theory is consistent with FDI inflows during financial crises being associated with the acquisition of stakes that grant control, rather than simply being acquisitions of cashflow stakes, and is also consistent with the subsequent “flipping” of the FDI assets, where the asset is sold to investors with higher valuations once the crisis abates."
Fundamentals Based Exchange Rate Prediction Revisited,IFM,2007,"This paper revisits the role of macroeconomic fundamentals as predictors for exchange rate movements at different horizons. It takes seriously the notion that the fundamental dynamics of an economy is hard to measure and that the usual measures, such as monetary aggregates, price index and deflator series and GDP, are imperfect approximations of these fundamental movements. As an alternative measure of underlying fundamental movements of economies, we extract domestic and foreign dynamic I(1) factors from large panels of economic data for Canada, the UK and the US. We show that these domestic and foreign dynamic factors are cointegrated with the US dollar/UK pound sterling and US dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rates. We then rotate these towards the respective exchange rates relative to the US dollar to get an estimate of the ‘fundamental’ or ‘core’ exchange rate levels, which serve as attractors for the actual exchange rates. Using the current deviation between the two as a predictor of future movements for the respective US dollar exchange rates results in successful forecasts."

"International Financial Integration, and Economic Growth: Accounting for the Efficiency Effect",IFM,2007,The empirical literature has not been successful in finding a robust positive effect of financial integration on economic development at the aggregate level. We use microeconomic estimates of the effect of foreign finance on firm level productivity to construct macroeconomic estimates of the proximate effect of foreign capital on GDP per capita. The efficiency effect of foreign capital per person can account for approximately 20% of total variation in log of GDP per capita across countries in the 1990s. Calibrations based on a neoclassical model that includes a positive feedback between financial integration and aggregate efficiency shows significant gains to output and welfare following financial integration for a sample of 40 developing countries.
"International Risk-Taking, Volatility and Consumption Growth",IFM,2007,"We provide evidence that higher international risk-taking leads to higher expected consumption growth. International risk is measured through the regression coefficient or beta of a country’s consumption growth with world consumption growth. We find that a one-standard-deviation increase in beta increases consumption growth by 40 basis points over the next five years. Unlike beta, higher volatility (total or idiosyncratic) has a negative effect on growth. Countries with higher betas have larger stocks of foreign assets, while countries with higher volatility have smaller stocks of foreign assets."
"Marginal Product of Capital, Capital Flows and Convergence",IFM,2007,"The neoclassical theory of economic growth suggests that capital inflows raise the speed of convergence because foreign financial capital is transformed into physical capital. We propose a new methodology to quantify the size of capital inflows which are transformed into physical capital. We use the predicted scale to calculate the output gains from capital flows. Our methodology takes into account cross-country differences and fluctuations in the price of investment goods relative to output. The theory predicts that inefficiency in producing investment goods reduces the gains from capital inflows. A sizable fraction of capital inflows is found to be transformed into physical capital. However, the gains from capital inflows are found to be extremely small."
US Shocks and Global Exchange Rate Configurations,IFM,2007,"The paper analyses the heterogeneity in the link between macroeconomic fundamentals and exchange rates. For a set of important US-specific economic shocks, it shows that such shocks have exerted a remarkably heterogeneous effect on global exchange rate configurations over the past 25 years. Despite a significant decline over time, this heterogeneity remains high as primarily currencies of a few industrialized countries provide the largest contribution to the adjustment of the effective US dollar exchange rate. The paper finds that this heterogeneity is not only due to policy choices of inflexible exchange rate regimes, but to an important extent due to market forces, in particular business cycle synchronization and the degree of financial integration – foremost in portfolio investment –but not to trade."
Varieties and the Transfer Problem: the Extensive Margin of Current Account Adjustment,IFM,2007,"The strong expansion in the volume of global trade has been accompanied by a vast change in its composition, in favor of differentiated manufacturing goods and services. A substantial fraction of trade growth occurs at the extensive margin, i.e. consists in export of new varieties, as opposed to a rise in the volume of trade in existing products. Yet most analyses of the macroeconomic adjustment required to correct global imbalances ignore trade at the extensive margin as well as firms’ net entry in the tradables market. In this paper we reconsider the classic ‘transfer problem’using a model where the set of exportables, importables and nontraded goods is endogenous. Our results suggest that the equilibrium exchange rate movements associated with a transfer are dramatically lower when firms’ entry and net creation of varieties are accounted for, relative to traditional models in which no adjustment occurs at the extentive margin. We also find that consumption and employment (hence welfare) are not highly sensitive to product differentiation, thus change little regardless of whether adjustment occurs through movements in relative prices or quantities. This result warns against interpreting the size of real depreciation associated with trade rebalancing as an index of macroeconomic distress. When applied to the current debate on global rebalancing, our results question the received wisdom about the need for further sharp real depreciation of the dollar."
Do Markets Care Who Chairs the Central Bank?,ME,2007,"This paper assesses the effects of central bank governor appointments on financial market expectations of monetary policy. To measure these effects, we assemble a new dataset of appointment announcements from 15 countries, and conduct an event study analysis on exchange rates, bond yields, and stock prices. The analysis reveals a significant reaction of exchange rates and bond yields to unexpected appointments. The reactions are not unidirectional, and thus do not suggest new governors suffer from a generic credibility problem. Federal Reserve chairman appointments stand out in terms of their unusually pronounced effects on financial markets."
"Endogenous Information, Menu Costs and Inflation Persistence",ME,2007,
Equilibrium Sticky Prices,ME,2007,"I offer a macroeconomic view of product markets that combines the desirable properties of the market-clearing models descended from the real business cycle model, on the one hand, and the sticky-price disequilibrium model of modern inflation analysis, on the other hand. I adhere strictly to the basic concept of equilibrium, in that buyers and sellers never transact in my model under conditions that could be improved through bilateral action. No transactors are prisoners of a sticky price that results in bilateral inefficiency. But I adopt the sticky-price view that transactions do occur at stale prices. I show that the equilibrium set for prices (and wages) is big enough under a reasonable calibration to include a wide range of stale prices. I show that many of the propositions about central-bank policy for controlling product prices from the established sticky-price models carry over to this view. A innovation in this model is an analysis of the effects of alternative policy regimes in amplifying disturbances in the product market as they reduce the effects in the labor market. When policy narrows the profit margin in retailing in order to sustain incentives for job creation when productivity is weak, the product market moves toward shortages, in a way made coherent in the model."
Investment and the Cost of Capital: New Evidence from the Corporate Bond Market,ME,2007,"We study the effect of variation in interest rates on investment spending, employing a large panel data set that links yields on outstanding corporate bonds to the issuer income and balance sheet statements. The bond price data—based on trades in the secondary market—enable us to construct a firm-specific measure of the user cost of capital based on the marginal cost of external finance as determined in the market for long-term corporate debt. Our results imply a robust and quantitatively important effect of the user cost of capital on the firm-level investment decisions. According to our estimates, a 1 percentage point increase in the user cost of capital implies a reduction in the rate of investment of 50 to 75 basis points and, in the long run, a 1 percent reduction in the stock of capital."
Measuring Changes in the Value of the Numeraire,ME,2007,"This paper estimates a common component in many price series that has an equiproportional effect on all prices. Changes in this component can be interpreted as changes in the value of the numeraire since, by definition, they leave all relative prices unchanged. The first aim of the paper is to measure these changes. The paper provides a framework for identifying this component, suggests an estimator for the component based on a dynamic factor model, and assesses its performance relative to alternative estimators. Using 187 U.S. time-series on prices, we estimate changes in the value of the numeraire from 1960 to 2006, and further decompose these changes into a part that is related to relative price movements and a residual ‘exogenous’ part. The second aim of the paper is to use these estimates to investigate two economic questions. First, we show that the size of exogenous changes in the value of the numeraire helps distinguish between different theories of pricing, and that the U.S. evidence argues against several strict theories of nominal rigidities. Second, we find that changes in the value of the numeraire are significantly related to changes in real quantities, and discuss interpretations of this apparent non-neutrality."
Measuring Oil-Price Shocks Using Market-Based Information,ME,2007,"We develop two measures of exogenous oil-price shocks for the period 1984 to 2006 based on market commentaries on daily oil-price fluctuations. Our measures are based on exogenous events that trigger substantial fluctuations in spot oil prices and are constructed to be free of endogenous and anticipatory movements. We find that the dynamic responses of output and prices implied by these measures are ‘well-behaved,’ and that the response of output is larger than the one implied by a conventional measure of oil-price shocks proposed in the literature. We then present a dynamic general-equilibrium model and assess to what extent it can account for the response of key macroeconomic variables to our oil-price shocks."
Product Creation and Destruction: Evidence and Price Implications,ME,2007,"This paper describes the extent and cyclicality of product creation and destruction in a large sector of the U.S. economy and quantifies its implications for the measurement of consumer prices. We find four times more entry and exit in product markets than is typically found in labor markets because most product turnover happens within the boundaries of the firm. Net product creation is strongly pro-cyclical, but contrary to the behavior of labor flows, it is primarily driven by creation rather than destruction. High rates of innovation are also accompanied by substantial price volatility of products. These facts suggest that the CPI deviates from a true cost-of-living index in three important dimensions. The quality bias that arises as new goods replace outdated ones causes the CPI to overstate inflation by 0.8 percent per year; the cyclicality of the bias implies that business cycles are more volatile than indicated by official statistics; and finally, sampling error is sufficiently large that over the last 10 years policymakers could not statistically distinguish whether quarterly inflation was accelerating or decelerating 65 percent of the time."
Sticky Information and Sticky Prices,ME,2007,"In the U.S. and Europe, prices change at least once a year. Yet nominal macro shocks seem to have real effects lasting well beyond a year. “Sticky information” models, as posited by Mankiw and Reis (2002), Sims (2003), and Woodford (2003), can reconcile micro flexibility with macro rigidity. We simulate a sticky information model in which price setters update information on macro shocks less frequently than information on micro shocks. We then examine price changes in the micro data underlying the U.S. CPI. Empirical price changes react to old information, just as sticky information models predict."
The Anatomy of a Price Cut: Discovering Organizational Sources of the Costs of Price Adjustment,ME,2007,"We use qualitative data to analyze the key elements of the price adjustment processes used at a large industrial manufacturer and several of its major customers. We focus on a specific episode, a price cut, which most vividly exemplifies the themes that emerge from our data. In the specific episode, market forces clearly dictate that the firm should cut prices, and everyone in the firm agrees with this assessment, suggesting a fairly straightforward decision where the organizational price adjustment costs ought to be low. Yet when we look deeper, and dissect how the firm implemented the price cut, we uncover a rich tapestry of frictions hidden within the organization. We document four specific organizational themes that emerge from the analyses of the data. (1) Each manager or each group within the firm handles only a part of the economic complexities of a given problem, using partial (albeit coherent) models of the marketplace. (2) Yet, when viewing the organization as a whole, across the different managers and groups, most of the economic complexities are dealt with. Thus, economics is not being done by individuals; rather it is an organizational issue. (3) The partial models used by managers may compete, conflict or collide creating organizational costs of price adjustment. (4) These frictions raise deep organizational issues which need to be resolved, suggesting an additional source of adjustment costs."
The Macroeconomic Effects of Oil Price Shocks: Why are the 2000s So Different from the 1970s?,ME,2007,"We characterize the macroeconomic performance of a set of industrialized economies in the aftermath of the oil price shocks of the 1970s and the last decade, focusing on the differences across episodes. We examine four different hypotheses for the mild effects on inflation and economic activity of the recent increase in the price of oil: (a) good luck (offsetting shocks) (b) smaller share of oil in production, (c) more flexible labor markets, (d) improvements in monetary policy. We conclude that all four have played an important role."
The Y-Theory of Investment,ME,2007,
VAR Analysis and the Great Moderation,ME,2007,"Most analyses of the U.S. Great Moderation have been based on VAR methods, and have consistently pointed toward good luck as the main explanation for the greater macroeconomic stability of recent years. Using data generated  by a New-Keynesian model in which the only source of change is the move from passive to active monetary policy, we show that VARs may misinterpret good policy for good luck. In particular, we detect significant breaks in estimated VAR innovation variances, although in the data generating process the volatilities of the structural shocks are constant across policy regimes. Counterfactual simulations, structural and reduced-form, point toward the incorrect conclusion of good luck. Our results cast doubts on the notion that existing VAR evidence is inconsistent with the good policy explanation of the Great Moderation."
A Dynamic Model of the Housing Market with a New Test for Market Efficiency,PERE,2007,"We use a unique dataset linking information about buyers and sellers to the complete census of housing transactions in the San Francisco metropolitan area for a period of 15 years to examine the microfoundations of housing market dynamics. We develop a tractable model of neighborhood choice in a dynamic setting along with a computationally straightforward estimation approach. This approach allows the observed and unobserved features of each neighborhood to evolve in a completely flexible way and uses information on neighborhood choice and the timing of moves to recover semi-parametrically: (i) preferences for housing and neighborhood attributes, (ii) preferences regarding the performance of the house as a financial asset (e.g., expected appreciation, volatility), and (iii) moving costs. This model and estimation approach is potentially applicable to the study a wide set of dynamic phenomena in housing markets and cities. In this paper, we use the model to develop testable implications of housing market efficiency and in particular rational expectations on the part of home buyers. We begin by showing that when the model is restricted so that all households have identical preferences, rational expectations implies the absence of predictable returns, i.e., the absence of the positive persistence in housing prices shown in the literature following Case and Shiller (1989). Thus, as the houses considered in an analysis are closer substitutes for one another, the predictability of returns should fall to zero. We examine this hypothesis empirically by studying the dynamics of housing prices at various levels of aggregation across both geographic and socioeconomic dimensions. The results of our analysis are generally inconsistent with rational expectations: there is significant positive persistence in appreciation across counties and Census PUMAs and significant negative persistence across Census tracts within counties or PUMAs within the San Francisco Bay Area. Collectively, these results suggest that a positive shock to prices in a given tract predicts significant positive returns in nearby tracts the following year. Future analysis will use the estimated structural model to formally test rational expectations. Note: We intend to divide the analysis presented in this paper into two papers roughly corresponding to the paragraphs of the abstract above. In preparing papers for conferences at SITE, NBER, and the Econometric Society meetings in Summer 2007, we have found it useful to temporarily fold these ideas into a single paper that summarizes where we stand in this research project."
Assessing the Effects of Local Taxation Using Microgeographic Data,PERE,2007,
Did the Death of Distance Hurt Detroit and Help New York?,PERE,2007,"One of the great attractions of cities is that urban proximity speeds the flow of ideas. Improvements in communications technology could erode this advantage and allow people and firms to decentralize. On the other hand, if cities have an edge in producing new ideas, then communication technology may strengthen the demand for cities by increasing the returns to innovation. Improvements in communication technology can increase the returns to innovation by allowing new ideas to be used in more geographic locales. This paper presents a model that illustrates these two rival effects that communication technology will have on cities. We then present some evidence suggesting that the model can help us to understand why the past 35 years have been kind to some cities, like New York and Boston, and devastating to others, like Cleveland and Detroit."
Do Households Benefit from Financial Deregulation and Innovation? The Case of the Mortgage Market,PERE,2007,"The U.S. mortgage market has experienced phenomenal change over the last 35 years. This paper develops and implements a technique for assessing the impact of changes in the mortgage market on households. Our framework, which is based on the permanent income hypothesis, that allows us to gauge the importance of borrowing constraints by estimating the empirical relationship between the value of a household's home purchase and its future income. We find that over the past several decades, housing markets have become less imperfect in the sense that households are now more able to buy homes whose values are consistent with their long-term income prospects. One issue that has received particular attention is the role that the housing Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have played in improving the market for housing finance. We find no evidence that the GSEs' activities have contributed to this phenomenon. This is true whether we look at all homebuyers, or at subsamples of the population whom we might expect to benefit particularly from GSE activity, such as low-income households and first-time homebuyers."
"Going Postal: What Black Employment in the Postal Service Reveals About the Increasing Cost of Racial Segregation, 1940-2000",PERE,2007,"Although economists largely agree that residential segregation has been harmful to African-American employment and earnings in recent decades, there is much less consensus about why this relationship emerged. This paper examines the association between segregation and the relative employment of black workers at the U.S. Postal Service, a large-scale employer with facilities in every city in the United States. Relative to whites, black employment at the post office is an increasing function of segregation, but only after 1970. Postal facilities have remained concentrated in downtown areas, near black enclaves, even as other firms suburbanized. We argue that this pattern is consistent with explanations of “bad” ghettos that emphasize physical isolation, or spatial mismatch, rather than social isolation."
Optimal Mortgage Design,PERE,2007,"This paper studies optimal mortgage design. A borrower (a household) with limited liability needs financial support from a lender (a big financial institution) to purchase a house. We characterize the optimal allocation in a continuous time setting in which (i) the borrower’s income is volatile and its realization is unobservable to the lender, (ii) the lender has a right to costly foreclose the loan and seize the house, (iii) the borrower’s intertemporal consumption preferences are represented by a constant discount factor, (iv) the lender discounts cash flows using a stochastic discount factor that depends on the market interest rate. We show that the optimal allocation can be implemented using either an option adjustable rate mortgage or a combination of an interest only mortgage with a home equity line of credit. Under the optimal contracts, mortgage payments and default rates are higher when the market interest rate is high. However, borrowers benefit from low mortgage payments and low default rates when the market interest rate is low. The gains from using the optimal contract relative to simpler mortgages are substantial and the biggest for those who buy pricey houses given their income level or make little or no downpayment. Thus, our analysis provides theoretical evidence that high concentration of the alternative mortgages in the subprime market can be economically efficient."
"Secondary Markets, Risk, and Access to Credit: Evidence from the Mortgage Market",PERE,2007,"Secondary markets for credit are widely believed to improve efficiency and increase access to credit. In part, this is because of their greater ability to manage risk. However, the degree to which secondary markets expand access to credit is virtually unknown. Using the mortgage market as an example, we begin to fill that gap. Our conceptual model suggests that secondary credit markets have potentially ambiguous effects on interest rates, but unambiguous positive effects on the number of loans issued. We focus our empirical analysis on the latter using 1992-2004 HMDA files for conventional, conforming, home purchase loans in conjunction with Census tract data. Findings confirm that an active secondary market increases mortgage origination rates. Between 2000 and 2004, for example, conventional loan purchases increased the share of applications originated by 15.6 percent, on average, roughly halving the denial rate (all else equal). In the high risk subprime sector, the analogous figure is 10.9 percent, while the marginal impact of secondary market purchases on origination rates is 3 to 10 times larger than for the market overall. These findings confirm that secondary markets provide opportunities to manage risk more effectively and increase access to credit. Evidence of a higher marginal impact of secondary markets among high-risk borrowers is especially important given recent government efforts to expand lending activity in low-income communities."
Skills in the City,PERE,2007,"This paper documents the allocation of skills across cities and estimates the impact of agglomeration on the hedonic prices of worker skills. In contrast to nearly all prior work, the paper focuses directly on fundamental worker skills – including a wide range of cognitive, people, and motor skills -- rather than on worker education. To identify these skills, we match occupation skill requirements as defined by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles with data from the Census and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The paper reaches four primary conclusions. First, the increase in productivity associated with agglomeration, as measured by the urban wage premium, is shown to be larger for workers with stronger cognitive skills. A one standard deviation increase in cognitive skills from the mean is associated with an increase of roughly one-fifth in the elasticity of wage with respect to MSA population. Second, the urban wage premium is also larger for a worker with strong people skills. Comparing a worker deemed able to interact well with others with one who is not, the interactive worker’s population elasticity of wage is half again larger. Clearly, soft skills are an essential aspect of agglomeration economies. Third, motor skills and physical strength are not rewarded to a greater degree in large cities. Urbanization thus enhances thinking and social interaction, rather than physical abilities. These results are robust to a variety of estimation strategies, including using NLSY variables that control for additional elements of worker quality and also to a worker-MSA fixed effect specification. Fourth, turning to the issue of the allocation of skills to cities, we find that mean skill levels are surprisingly uniform across cities of different sizes. Large cities are only slightly more skilled than are small cities. Cities of different sizes are closer to equal in their skill endowments than in either their education levels or their breakdown by occupation or industry."
The Corporate Wealth Effect: From Real Estate Shocks to Corporate Investment,PERE,2007,
Why Has House Price Dispersion Gone Up?,PERE,2007,"We investigate the 30 year increase in the level and dispersion of house prices across U.S. metropolitan areas in a calibrated dynamic general equilibrium island model. The model is based on two main assumptions: households flow in and out metropolitan areas in response to local wage shocks, and the housing supply cannot adjust instantly because of regulatory constraints. In our equilibrium, house prices compensate for cross-sectional wage differences. Feeding in our model the 30 year increase in cross-sectional wage dispersion that we document based on metropolitan-level data, we generate the observed increase in house price level and dispersion. The calibration also reveals that, while a baseline level of regulation is important, a tightening of regulation by itself  cannot account for the increase in house price level and dispersion: in equilibrium, workers flow out of tightly regulated towards less regulated metropolitan areas, undoing most of the price impact of additional local supply regulations. Finally, the calibration with increasing wage dispersion suggests that the welfare effects of housing supply regulation are large."
Capital Allocation,RISK; CF,2007,
The Bank as Grim Reaper: Debt Composition and Recoveries of Defaulted Debt,RISK; CF,2007,"We offer a model and evidence that private debtholders play a key role in setting the endogenous asset value threshold below which corporations declare bankruptcy. The model, in the spirit of Black and Cox (1976), implies that the recovery rate at emergence from bankruptcy on all of the firm’s debt is related to the pre-bankruptcy share of private debt in all of the firm’s debt. Empirical evidence supports this implication. Indeed, debt composition has a more economically material empirical influence on recovery than all other variables we try taken together. This special role of private debt in the capital structure has important implications for pricing models and risk management."
Asset Pricing in Large Information Networks,AP,2008,"We study asset pricing in economies with large information networks. We derive closed form expressions for price, volatility, profitability and several other key variables, as a function of the topological structure of the network. We focus on networks that are sparse and have power law degree distributions, in line with empirical studies of large scale human networks. Our analysis allows us to rank information networks along several dimensions and to derive several novel results. For example, price volatility is a non-monotone function of network connectedness, as are average expected profits. Moreover, the profit distribution among investors is intimately linked to the properties of the information network. We also examine which networks are stable, in the sense that no agent has an incentive to change the network structure. We show that if agents are ex ante identical, then strong conditions are needed to allow for non-degenerate network structures, including power-law distributed networks. If, on the other hand, agents face different costs of forming links, which we interpret broadly as differences in social skills, then power-law distributed networks arise quite naturally."
Can Rare Events Explain the Equity Premium Puzzle?,AP,2008,"Probably not. First, allowing the probabilities attached to the states of the economy to differ from their sample frequencies, the Consumption-CAPM is still rejected by the data and requires a very high level of Relative Risk Aversion (RRA) in order to rationalize the stock market risk premium. This result holds for a variety of data sources and samples – including ones starting as far back  as 1890. Second, we elicit the likelihood of observing an Equity Premium Puzzle (EPP) if the data were generated by the rare events probability distribution needed to rationalize the puzzle with a low level of RRA. We find that the historically observed EPP would be very unlikely to arise. Third, we find that the rare events explanation of the EPP significantly worsens the ability of the Consumption-CAPM to explain the cross-section of asset returns. This is due to the fact that, by assigning higher probabilities to bad – economy wide – states in which consumption growth is low and all the assets in the cross-section tend to yield low returns, the rare events hypothesis reduces the cross-sectional dispersion of consumption risk relative to the cross-sectional variation of average returns."
Can Time-Varying Risk of Rare Disasters Explain Aggregate Stock Market Volatility?,AP,2008,"What role does the risk of a rare disaster play in explaining the high equity premium and stock market volatility? This paper investigates this question in a continuous-time model in which the risk of a rare disaster varies over time. I build on the work of Barro (2006), who shows that introducing a small probability of a large negative shock into the endowment process can lead to a large equity premium, even when the representative agent has low risk aversion. I generalize this work along two dimensions: the probability of a rare disaster is allowed to vary over time and the representative agent is allowed to have recursive preferences. These generalizations allow the model to explain the observed volatility of stock returns, At the same time, the model preserves the high equity premium and low riskfree rate found by Barro, while maintaining low volatility for the government bill rate."
Depression Babies: Do Macroeconomic Experiences Affect Risk-Taking?,AP,2008,"We investigate whether individuals’ experiences of macro-economic shocks have long-term effects on their risk attitudes, as often suggested for the generation that experienced the Great Depression. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances from 1964-2004, we find that individuals that have experienced high stock-market returns throughout their lives report lower risk aversion, are more likely to be stock-market participants, and, if they participate, invest a higher fraction of liquid wealth in stocks. At the same time, individuals that have experienced high inflation are less likely to invest their (non-stock) assets in bonds and favor inflation-proof cash-like investments. All results are estimated controlling for age, year effects, and a broad set of household characteristics. Our estimates indicate that the most recent returns and inflation rates have the strongest effect, but experiences earlier in life still have some influence, even several decades later. Thus, the experience of risky asset payoffs over the course of an individual’s life affects subsequent risk-taking. Our results can explain, for example, the relatively low rates of stock-market participation among young households in the early 1980s (following the disappointing stock-market returns in the 1970s depression) and the relatively high participation rates of young investors in the late 1990s (following the boom years in the 1990s)."
Durability of Output and Expected Stock Returns,AP,2008,"The demand for durable goods is more cyclical than that for nondurable goods and services. Consequently, the cash flow and stock returns of durable-good producers are exposed to higher systematic risk. Using the NIPA input-output tables, we construct portfolios of durable-good, nondurable-good, and service producers. In the cross-section, a strategy that is long on durables and short on services earns a sizable risk premium. In the time series, a strategy that is long on durables and short on the market portfolio earns a countercyclical risk premium. We develop an equilibrium asset-pricing model that explains these empirical findings."
Information in (and not in) the Term Structure,AP,2008,"Casual intuition says that today’s term structure reflects all information investors have about expected future yields. However, this is not required by finance theory, nor is it consistent with observed Treasury yield behavior. Kalman filter estimation uncovers a factor that has an almost imperceptible effect on yields, but has clear forecast power for future short-term interest rates and substantial forecast power for future excess bond returns. The factor appears to be related to short-run fluctuations in economic activity."
Rare Disasters and Exchange Rates,AP,2008,"We propose a new model of exchange rates, which yields a theory of the forward premium puzzle. Our explanation combines two ingredients: the possibility of rare economic disasters, and an asset view of the exchange rate. Our model is frictionless, has complete markets, and works for an arbitrary number of countries. In the model, rare worldwide disasters can occur and affect each country’s productivity. Each country’s exposure to disaster risk varies over time according to a mean-reverting process. Risky countries command high risk premia: they feature a depreciated exchange rate and a high interest rate. As their risk premium mean reverts, their exchange rate appreciates. Therefore, currencies of high interest rate countries appreciate on average. To make the notion of disaster risk more implementable, we show how options prices might in principle uncover latent disaster risk, and help forecast exchange rate movements. We then extend the framework to incorporate two factors: a disaster risk factor, and a business cycle factor. We calibrate the model and obtain quantitatively realistic values for the volatility of the exchange rate, the forward premium puzzle regression coefficients, and near-random walk exchange rate dynamics. Finally, we solve a model of stock markets across countries, which yields a series of predictions about the joint behavior of exchange rates, bonds, options and stocks across countries. The evidence from the options market appears to be supportive of the model."
The Wealth-Consumption Ratio,AP,2008,"To measure the wealth-consumption ratio, we estimate an exponentially affine model of the stochastic discount factor on bond yields and stock returns. We use that discount factor to compute the no-arbitrage price of a claim to aggregate US consumption. Our estimates indicate that total wealth is much safer than stock market wealth. The consumption risk premium is only 2.2 percent, substantially below the equity risk premium of 6.9 percent. As a result, our estimate of the wealth-consumption ratio is much higher than the price-dividend ratio on stocks throughout the post-war period. The high wealth-consumption ratio implies that the average US household has a lot of wealth, most of it human wealth. A variance decomposition of the wealth-consumption ratio shows less return predictability overall, but most of the return predictability is for future interest rates, not excess returns. We conclude that the properties of the total wealth portfolio are more similar to those of a long-maturity bond portfolio than those of a stock portfolio. The differences that we find between the risk-return characteristics of equity and total wealth suggest that equity is a special asset class."
Value and Momentum Everywhere,AP,2008,"We study jointly the returns to value and momentum strategies for individual stocks within countries, stock indices across countries, government bonds across countries, currencies, and commodities. Value and momentum generate abnormal returns everywhere we look. Exploring their common factor structure across asset classes, we find that value (momentum) in one asset class is positively correlated with value (momentum) in other asset classes, and value and momentum are negatively correlated within and across asset classes. Long-run consumption risk is positively linked to both value and momentum, as is global recession risk to a lesser extent, while global liquidity risk is related positively to value and negatively to momentum. These patterns emerge from the power of examining value and momentum everywhere at once and are not easily detectable when examining each asset class in isolation."
Beyond Cash Flow and Voting Rights: Valuation and Performance of Firms in Complex Ownership Structures,CF,2008,"We propose new measures to describe the ownership structure of family business groups that go beyond the standard measures of cash flow and voting rights. Our measures include the degree of pyramiding in the ownership structure of a group firm, and the centrality of a firm in the group structure (e.g., whether a given firm is used by the family to control other group firms). We use a unique dataset of Korean family business groups (chaebols) to provide evidence that relates these new ownership variables to the performance and valuation of group firms. In particular, we show that firms with high investment requirements and/or low profitability are more likely to be set up in pyramids (a selection effect). In addition, central firms appear to have lower market valuations than public group firms that do not hold large equity stakes in other group firms (a valuation effect). Our results suggest that cash flow and voting rights are not the only ownership variables that are associated with performance and valuation of group firms. These results also support Almeida and Wolfenzon’s (2006) arguments that the family selects pyramidal ownership to take advantage of the cash retained in the central firms of the group, and that pyramidal investments are not beneficial for the minority shareholders of the central firms (who discount the value of their shares accordingly)."
Corporate Governance and Innovation: Theory and Evidence,CF,2008,"We develop a theory of the effects of external corporate governance mechanisms — such as takeover pressure — and internal mechanisms — such as compensation contracts and monitoring intensity — on innovation by firms. Our theory generates the following testable predictions: (i) innovation varies non-monotonically in a U-shaped manner with takeover pressure, (ii) innovation increases with monitoring intensity, and (iii) the sensitivity of innovation to changes in takeover pressure declines with monitoring intensity. We show strong empirical support for these predictions using both ex ante and ex post measures of innovative activity. We use difference-in-difference tests that exploit the natural source of exogenous variation created by the passage of state-level anti-takeover laws to identify the effects of governance mechanisms on innovation. Our study suggests that innovation is fostered by either strong anti-takeover laws that significantly deter takeovers or an unhindered market for corporate control. Monitoring is most effective in enhancing innovation at intermediate levels of takeover pressure. Effective shareholder monitoring not only enhances innovation, but also reduces the sensitivity of innovation to variations in external takeover pressure created by the passage of anti-takeover statutes."
Does Corporate Governance Matter in Competitive Industries?,CF,2008,"By reducing the fear of a hostile takeover, business combination (BC) laws weaken corporate governance and create more opportunity for managerial slack. Using the passage of BC laws as a source of exogenous variation, we examine if these laws have a different effect on firms in competitive and non-competitive industries. While firms in non-competitive industries experience a significant drop in performance after the laws’ passage, firms in competitive industries experience virtually no effect. Our results are consistent with the notion that competition mitigates managerial slack. When we examine which agency problem competition mitigates, we find evidence in support of a “quiet-life” hypothesis. While capital expenditures are unaffected by the passage of the BC laws, input costs, wages, and overhead costs all increase, and only so in non-competitive industries. We also conduct event studies around the dates of the first newspaper reports about the BC laws. We find that while firms in non-competitive industries experience a significant stock price decline, firms in competitive industries experience a small and insignificant price impact."
Equity Markets and Institutions: The Case of Japan,CF,2008,"Corporate ownership and financing in Japan in the 20 th century are striking. In the first half of the 20 th century equity markets were active in raising more than 50% of the external financing of Japanese companies. Ownership was dispersed both by the standards of other developed economies at the time and even by those of the UK and US today. In the second half of the 20 th century, bank finance dominated external finance and interlocking shareholdings by banks and companies became widespread. The change from equity to bank finance and from an outsider system of public equity markets to an insider system of private equity in the middle of the 20th century coincided precisely with a marked increase in investor protection. Informal institutional arrangements rather than formal investor protection explain the existence of equity in the first half of the century-business co-ordinators in the early 20 th century and zaibatsu later. Insider ownership in the form of bank ownership and cross-shareholdings emerged in the second half of the century as a response to the equity financing needs of fast growing firms and the financial restructuring of failing firms."
Inheritance Law and Investment in Family Firms,CF,2008,"We investigate whether inheritance law constrains investment in family firms. Using a model of succession in family firms where the law may constrain the entrepreneur to give a minimal stake to non-controlling heirs, we show that the size of this stake reduces investment in family firms, by reducing the firm’s ability to pledge future income streams to external financiers. We take this prediction to the data, by collecting information about inheritance law in 62 countries. Wherever present, these laws effectively constrain the stake that can be given to the controlling and non-controlling heirs. Using a purpose-built indicator of the permissiveness of inheritance law together with measures of investor protection and data for 10,245 firms from 32 countries over the 1990-2006 interval, we find that stricter inheritance law is associated with lower investment in family firms, while it leaves investment unaffected in non-family  firms, and that this result survives several robustness checks. Moreover, as predicted by the model, inheritance laws affects investment only in family firms that experience a succession."
"Institutional Investors, Credit Supply Uncertainty, and the Leverage of the Firm",CF,2008,"We examine the effect of the withdrawal risk of institutional bondholders (e.g., mutual bond funds) on the leverage of the firm using a novel dataset. Our main finding is that the withdrawal or run risk of the firm’s bond investor base (as measured by (i) the average portfolio churn rate of investors holding the firm’s bonds, or (ii) the prevalence of mutual funds among the firm’s bondholders as opposed to insurance companies) has a negative and significant effect on the leverage of the firm. The withdrawal risk also has a negative and significant effect on the firm’s probability of issuing bonds, and a positive and significant effect on the firm’s probability of issuing equity and borrowing from banks. These findings suggest that the credit supply uncertainty arising from institutional investors’ withdrawal risk significantly affects the firm’s capital structure."
Leverage and Pricing in Buyouts: An Empirical Analysis,CF,2008,"This paper provides an empirical analysis of the financial structure of large recent buyouts. We collect detailed information of the financings of 153 large buyouts (averaging over $1 billion in enterprise value). We document the manner in which these important transactions are financed. Buyout leverage is cross-sectionally unrelated to the leverage of matched public firms, and is largely driven by other factors than what explains leverage in public firms. In particular, the economy-wide cost of borrowing seems to drive leverage. Prices paid in buyouts are related to the prices observed for matched firms in the public market, but are also strongly affected by the economy-wide cost of borrowing. These results are consistent with a view in which the availability of financing impacts booms and busts in the private equity market."
Private Equity and Long-Run Investment: The Case of Innovation,CF,2008,"A long-standing controversy is whether LBOs relieve managers from short-term pressures from public shareholders, or whether LBO funds themselves are driven by short-term profit motives and sacrifice long-term growth to boost short-term performance. We investigate 495 transactions with a focus on one form of long-term activities, namely investments in innovation as measured by patenting activity. We find no evidence that LBOs are associated with a decrease these activities. Relying on standard measures of patent quality, we find that patents granted to firms involved in private equity transactions are more cited (a proxy for economic importance), show no significant shifts in the fundamental nature of the research, and are more concentrated in the most important and prominent areas of companies' innovative portfolios."
Public and Private Enforcement of Securities Laws: Resource-Based Evidence,CF,2008,"Recent work in finance concludes that financial market development is facilitated by private enforcement of investor protection ─ primarily via disclosure and private lawsuits ─ but not strongly affected by public enforcement of regulatory rules, or even criminal penalties. Several World Bank pronouncements adopt this view. We examine the value of public enforcement, by introducing two new measures of public enforcement based on securities regulators’ real resources ─ their staffing levels and budgets. Four standard measures of stock market development (market capitalization, trading volume, the number of domestic firms, and the number of IPOs) are all strongly related to these resource-based measures of public enforcement, with more intense public enforcement regularly correlating with strong financial outcomes. In horse races between our measures of public enforcement and the most common measures of private enforcement, public enforcement is typically at least as important as private enforcement in explaining important financial market outcomes around the world."
Public Information and Coordination: Evidence from a Credit Registry Expansion,CF,2008,"When many creditors lend to the same borrower each faces a potential coordination problem. Suspension of finance by one creditor can disrupt the operations of the firm and lower the value of other creditors’ claims. We study a change in the Argentine public credit registry to provide evidence that these problems are exacerbated when credit market information is public. In April 1998 the registry was expanded to include borrowers with less than $200,000 in total debt. We identify the effect of public information by studying the change in lending outcomes on borrowers just below the $200,000 cut-off using borrowers above the cut-off as a control group. Firms affected by the expansion experience a decline in lending and an increase in default rates. These effects come from firms who borrow from multiple creditors and are hence subject to potential coordination failures. Firms appear to mitigate their exposure to coordination problems by increasing the concentration of their borrowing across banks. We show that the correlation across lending decisions of different banks to the same firm increases after the registry expansion, and decreases after lending becomes concentrated."
Reputation and Competition: Evidence from the Credit Rating Industry,CF,2008,"Fair and accurate credit ratings arguably play an important role in the financial system. In an environment absent free entry of rating agencies, the provision of quality ratings is at least partially sustained by the reputational concerns of the rating agencies. The economically significant entry of a third agency into a market that was previously best described as a duopoly provides a unique experiment to examine the effect of increased competition on the disciplining effects of reputation. Using a variety of data sources, we find that ratings became friendlier to issuers and less informative as competition increased. First, we find that the average credit ratings issues by the two incumbent agencies increased. Second, we find that the correlations between bond yields and ratings fell. And lastly, negative stock price responses to announced rating downgrades are larger in absolute value, consistent with a lowering of the quality standards in that a downgrade in this weaker ratings environment is even worse news. Ultimately, our findings are consistent with models that suggest competition can impede the reputational mechanism."
Takeover Activity and Target Valuations: Feedback Loops in Financial Markets,CF,2008,"Asset prices both affect and reflect real decisions. This paper provides evidence of this two-way relationship in the takeover market, where acquisition likelihoods and target valuations simultaneously interact. We find that a firm’s discount to its maximum potential value significantly attracts takeovers (the “trigger effect”) – but market expectations of an acquisition cause the discount to shrink (the “anticipation effect”), reducing the probability that the bid actually occurs. An inter-quartile change in takeover probability leads to a 5 percentage point decrease in the discount, while an inter-quartile change in the discount leads to a 3-4 percentage point increase in acquisition likelihood. This feedback loop reduces the effectiveness of takeovers in correcting managerial failure, and may explain previous findings on the insignificance of raw valuations for takeover probability. In contrast to many existing papers, here financial efficiency reduces real effi ciency, since forward-looking prices may deter the very actions that they anticipate."

The Importance of Hold Up in Contracting: Evidence from a Field Experiment,CF,2008,"This paper explores how the relationship specificity of the investment affects the ex-ante structure of contracts and the ex-post resolution of an ensuing holdup problem. We set up a field experiment in the wholesale market for pens in India where we sent entrepreneurs as auditors to procure large orders of pens from wholesale dealers. We vary the specificity of the order by buying either generic or custom-printed lots of pens. We find that ex ante contracts alleviate the risk of holdup by demanding 25% higher upfront payments on average in the case of custom-printed pens. But we do not find that wholesalers demand higher prices for custom-printed pens after controlling for the cost of the printing. We also test the ex post renegotiation of contracts. We find that wholesalers offer a higher price discount in case of custom-printed than generic pens. Furthermore, the higher the upfront payment, the lower is the discount offered by the wholesaler, which suggests that the wholesaler’s bargaining power affects his willingness to renegotiate. Interestingly, in case of generic pens, we also find that wholesalers are often willing to refund the upfront paid. These findings confirm the predictions of Grossman and Hart (1986) or Hart and Moore (1990) on the importance of holdup costs in contracting. But in addition, there is large variation in contract structures which is not explained by specificity of investment and bargaining power based on outside options."
Understanding Bank Runs: The Importance of Depositor-Bank Relationships and Networks,CF,2008,"We use a unique, new, database to examine micro depositor level data for a bank that faced a run. We use minute-by-minute depositor withdrawal data to understand the role of social networks, the effectiveness of deposit insurance, the role of relationships and other factors in influencing depositor propensity to run. We employ methods from the epidemiology literature which examine how diseases spread to estimate transmission probabilities of depositors running, and the significant underlying factors. Our results suggest that social network effects are important but are mitigated by other factors, in particular the length and depth of the bank-depositor relationship. Depositors with longer relationships, and those who have availed of loans from a bank are less likely to run during a crisis, suggesting that cross-selling acts not just as a revenue generator but also as a complementary insurance mechanism for the bank. We further find that deposit insurance is only partially effective in preventing bank runs. Finally, we find long term effects of a bank crisis in that depositors who run do not return back to the bank. Our results help understand the underlying dynamics of bank runs and hold important policy implications."
Why Do Foreigners Invest in the United States?,CF,2008,"Why are foreigners willing to invest almost $2 trillion per year in the United States? The answer affects if the existing pattern of global imbalances can persist and if the United States can continue to finance  its current account deficit without a major change in asset prices and returns. This paper tests various hypotheses and finds that standard portfolio allocation models and diversification motives are poor predictors of foreign holdings of U.S. liabilities. Instead, foreigners hold greater shares of their investment portfolios in the United States if they have less developed financial markets. The magnitude of this effect decreases with income per capita. Countries with fewer capital controls and greater trade with the United States also invest more in U.S. equity and bond markets, and foreign investors ""chase returns"" in their purchases of U.S. equities (although not bonds). The empirical results showing a primary role of financial market development in driving foreign purchases of U.S. portfolio liabilities supports recent theoretical work on global imbalances."

"Collateral, Financial Intermediation, and the Distribution of Debt Capacity",EFEL,2008,"To seize investment opportunities due to temporarily low asset prices, borrowers may optimally conserve debt capacity. However, debt capacity is limited when financing is subject to collateral constraints due to limited enforcement. Borrowers may choose to exhaust their debt capacity and thus may be unable to take advantage of such opportunities, even if they can arrange for loan commitments or hedge financing needs. The cost of conserving debt capacity is the opportunity cost of foregone investment, which is higher for more productive and less well capitalized borrowers. Such borrowers may hence exhaust their debt capacity and may be forced to downsize when investment opportunities arise but cash flows are low. Thus, capital may be less productively deployed then. Higher collateralizability may make the contraction more severe. Financial intermediaries, who are better able to collateralize claims, require capital and, in such times, intermediary capital may be scarce and spreads between intermediated and direct finance high, forcing borrowers who exhaust their debt capacity to downsize by even more."
"Debt Literacy, Financial Experience, and Over-Indebtedness",EFEL,2008,"Using a new dataset collected from a November 2007 survey, we analyze a national sample of Americans with respect to their debt literacy, financial experience, and their judgments about the level of their indebtedness. Debt literacy is measured by a set of questions testing knowledge of fundamental concepts related to debt and by a measure of self-assessed financial knowledge. Financial experience is measured by the participant’s experience with a wide range of traditional borrowing, alternative borrowing, and investing activities. Overindebtedness is a self-reported measure. Overall, we find that debt literacy is low, especially among certain demographic groups. Even after controlling for demographics, we find a strong relationship between debt literacy and both financial experiences and debt loads. Generally, individuals with lower levels of debt literacy tend to transact in high-cost manners (incurring fees and using high cost borrowing). The less literate also report that their debt loads are excessive or that they are unable to judge their debt position."
Dynamic Agency and the q Theory of Investment,EFEL,2008,"We introduce dynamic agency into the neoclassical q theory of investment. Costly external financing arises endogenously from dynamic agency, and influences firm value and investment. Agency conflicts drive a history-dependent wedge between average q and marginal q, and make the firm’s investment policy dependent on realized profits. A larger realized profit induces higher investment, and hence a larger firm. Investment is relatively insensitive to average q when the firm is “financially constrained ”(i.e. has low financial slack). Conversely, investment is sensitive to average q when the firm is relatively “financially unconstrained,” (i.e. has high financial slack). Moreover, the agent’s optimal compensation is in the form of future claims on the firm’s cash flows when the firm’s past profits are relatively low and the firm has less financial slack, whereas cash compensation is preferred when the firm has been profitable, agency concerns are less severe, and the firm is growing rapidly. To study the effect of serial correlation of productivity shocks on investment and firm dynamics, we extend our model to allow the firm’s output price to be stochastic. We show that, in contrast to static agency models, the agent’s compensation in the optimal dynamic contract will depend not only on the firm’s past performance, but also on output prices, even though they are beyond the agent’s control. This dependence of the agent’s compensation on exogenous output prices (for incentive reasons) further feeds back on the firm’s investment, and provides a channel to amplify and propagate the response of investment to output price shocks via dynamic agency."
Estimating Firm-Level Risk,EFEL,2008,"Most models incorporating firm heterogeneity assume that idiosyncratic productivity follows an AR(1) process. However, there remains substantial disagreement on the persistence parameter, with estimates ranging from a unit root to a nearly iid component. This paper uses the information  embedded in firms’ investment decisions to estimate the productivity process: investment reacts more to a permanent shock than to a transitory shock. I apply this methodology to a sample drawn from Compustat, using a method of moments estimator. The estimates give an important role to permanent shocks. I study the implications of these estimates in a general equilibrium model of firm dynamics. Mistaking permanent shocks for persistent shocks can lead to incorrect inferences regarding, for instance, the effect of a friction on aggregate productivity. As an example of application of this methodology, I also study the trends and cycles in firm-level volatility."
Euler Equation Methods for Discrete Choice Models: A Capital Accumulation Application,EFEL,2008,"This paper studies capital adjustment costs at the establishment level. Our goal here is to characterize these adjustment costs, which are important for understanding both the dynamics of aggregate investment and the impact of various policies on capital accumulation. Our estimation strategy searches for parameters that minimize ex post errors in an Euler equation. This strategy is quite common in models for which adjustment occurs in consecutive periods. Here, we extend that logic to the estimation of parameters of dynamic optimization problems in which non-convexities lead to extended periods of investment inactivity. This methodology allows us to take the structural model directly to the data, avoiding simulation-based methods that rely on user-designated moments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, we first undertake several Monte Carlo exercises using data generated by the structural model. We then estimate capital adjustment costs for U.S. manufacturing establishments in two sectors"
Fiscal Policy in an Incomplete Markets Economy,EFEL,2008,"We study the quantitative implications of fiscal policy decisions in an heterogeneous agent model with incomplete markets, and where equity and government debt are not perfect substitutes. This  set-up allows us to study the impact of the decisions on macroeconomic activity, cross-sectional wealth distribution, asset prices and the risk premium, in a unified framework. For a given level of government expenditures, a 20% permanent increase in government debt decreases the steady-state capital stock between 1:7% and 2:4%, depending on how the new debt is financed, while the cost of government debt increases by approximately 25 basis points, inducing households to hold the extra bonds. Given the crowding out of investment, the return on capital also rises between 15 to 20 basis points. Financing temporary increases in government expenditures also has large crowding-out effects. A one-off 2:5% increase in the capital income tax rate used to finance additional expenditures leads to a 6:3% reduction in the capital stock in that year, and a 5-year half-life for returning to the steady-state level. Despite the modest impact of fiscal policy decisions on asset returns, we show that it is very important to measure the impact of those decisions in a model where the capital stock and government bonds are not perfect substitutes. More precisely, our results identify the portfolio re-allocation behavior of households (asset substitution channel), as an important factor for determining the impact of fiscal policy decisions on capital accumulation, and aggregate economic activity in general. On the other hand, the crowding-out effect of taxes through the tightening of liquidity constraints is much smaller, since the households potentially affected by these constraints own a very small fraction of the capital stock."
"Portfolio Choice in Retirement: Health Risk and the Demand for Annuities, Housing, and Risky Assets",EFEL,2008,"This paper develops a consumption and portfolio-choice model of a retiree who allocates wealth among four assets: a riskless bond, a risky asset, a real annuity, and housing. Unlike previous studies that treat health expenditures as exogenous negative income shocks, this paper builds on the Grossman model to endogenize health expenditures as investments in health. I calibrate the model to explain the joint evolution of health status and the composition of wealth for retirees, aged 65 to 96, in the Health and Retirement Study. I use the calibrated model to assess the welfare gains of an actuarially fair annuity market. The welfare gain is less than 1% of wealth for the median-health retiree at age 65, and the welfare gain is about 10% of wealth for the healthiest."
The Burden of the Nondiversifiable Risk of Entrepreneurship,EFEL,2008,"Entrepreneurs are financially specialized in their own companies and bear the burden of the idiosyncratic risk. We study this burden in the case of high-tech companies funded by venture capital. The standard venture-capital contract rewards entrepreneurs only for creating successful companies that go public or are acquired on favorable terms. As a result, entrepreneurs receive no help from venture capital in avoiding the huge idiosyncratic risk of the startup. Over the past 20 years, the typical venture-backed entrepreneur earned $4.4 million from each company that succeeded in attracting venture funding. Entrepreneurs with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of two and with less than $0.7 million would be better off in a salaried position than in a startup, despite the prospect of an average personal payoff of $4.4 million and the possibility of payoffs over $1 billion. We conclude that startups attract entrepreneurs with lower risk aversion, higher initial assets, preferences for entrepreneurship over  employment, and optimistic beliefs about the payoffs from their products."
The Consequences of Mortgage Credit Expansion: Evidence from the 2007 Mortgage Default Crisis,EFEL,2008,
What's Vol Got to Do With It?,EFEL,2008,"Uncertainty plays a key role in economics, finance, and decision sciences. Financial markets, in particular derivative markets, provide fertile ground for understanding how perceptions of economic uncertainty and cashflow risk manifest themselves in asset prices. We demonstrate that the variance premium, defined as the difference between the squared VIX index and expected realized variance, captures attitudes toward uncertainty. We show conditions under which the variance premium displays significant time variation and return predictability. A calibrated, generalized Long-Run Risks model generates a variance premium with time variation and return predictability that is consistent with the data, while simultaneously matching the levels and volatilities of the market return and risk free rate. Our evidence indicates an important role for transient non-Gaussian shocks to fundamentals that affect agents’ views of economic uncertainty and prices."

A Solution to the Default Risk-Business Cycle Disconnect,IFM,2008,"Models of business cycles in emerging economies explain the negative correlation between country spreads and output by modeling default risk as an exogenous interest rate on working capital. Sovereign default models explain the cyclical properties of country spreads by assuming an exogenous output cost of default with special features, and they underestimate debt-output ratios by a wide margin. We propose a solution to this default risk-business cycle disconnect based on a model of sovereign default with endogenous output dynamics. The model replicates observed V-shaped output dynamics around defaults, countercyclical sovereign spreads, and high debt ratios, and it also matches the variability of consumption and the countercyclical fluctuations of net exports. Three features of the model are key for these results: (1) working capital loans pay for imported inputs; (2) default triggers an efficiency loss as final goods producers switch to domestic inputs that are imperfect susbtitutes for imported inputs, and labor reallocates from final goods to intermediate goodss production; and (3) default on the foreign obligations of firms and the government occurs simultaneously."
Aggregation and the PPP Puzzle in a Sticky Price Model,IFM,2008,"We study the purchasing power parity (PPP) puzzle in a multi-sector, two country sticky price model. Across sectors, firms differ in the extent of price stickiness, in accordance with recent microeconomic evidence on price setting in various countries. Combined with local currency pricing, this leads sectoral real exchange rates to have heterogeneous dynamics. We show analytically that in such a heterogeneous economy deviations of the real exchange rate from PPP are more volatile and persistent than in a counterfactual one-sector world economy that features the same average frequency of price changes, and is otherwise identical to the multi-sector world economy. When calibrated to match the recent microeconomic evidence on the frequency of price changes, the model produces a half-life of deviations from PPP of 45 months. In contrast, the half-life of such deviations in the counterfactual one-sector economy is only slightly above one year. We provide a decomposition of this difference in persistence and find that over 90% of the gap is due to the fact that the counterfactual one-sector model is misspecified. An aggregation effect that arises in the heterogeneous economy accounts for the remaining fraction. As a by-product, our results help clarify the “PPP Strikes Back debate” (Imbs et al. 2005a,b and Chen and Engel 2005)."
"Cross-Border Prices, Costs, and Markups",IFM,2008,"We use data on retail prices and wholesale costs for detailed products at the barcode level from 325 stores of a large grocery chain to measure the effect of the US-Canadian border on market segmentation. Theoretically, we use a model of pricing and location on the circle to document possible patterns of cross-border prices. Empirically, we find clear evidence of international market segmentation. Cross-border price gaps are significantly higher than within country price gaps. Using the precise geographic location of each store, we find that UPC level prices and wholesale costs are discontinuous at the border. Our findings indicate that most differences in cross border prices arise from differences in an apparently tradable component of costs and not from systematic mark-up differences."
Elasticity Optimism,IFM,2008,"Estimates of the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign varieties are small in macroeconomic data, but substantially larger in disaggregated microeconomic studies. This may be an artifact of heterogeneity. We use disaggregated multilateral trade data to structurally identify imports elasticities in the US. We spell out a partial equilibrium model to aggregate them adequately at the country level. We compare aggregate elasticities that impose equality across sectors, to estimates allowing for heterogeneity. The former are similar in value to conventional macroeconomic estimates; but they are more than twice larger - up to 5 - with heterogeneity. The parameter is central to calibrated models in most of international economics. We discuss the difference our corrected estimate makes in various areas of international economics, including the dynamics of external balances, the international transmission of shocks, international portfolio choice and optimal monetary policy."
Exchange Rates and Producer Prices: Evidence from Micro-Data,IFM,2008,"We use a unique data set that matches survey data on domestic and export prices to plant census information to address the following questions. Are desired markups constant or variable? How are markups adjusted in response to demand shocks? Does the probability that prices change respond to demand shocks? Our identification strategy is based on matched observations for the price charged for a given product by a given plant in two markets that are segmented by variable exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates shift perceived relative demand across the two markets while potentially also affecting costs. We use fixed effects to control for changes in marginal cost and focus on markup responses to demand shocks. Our findings suggest that desired markups are not constant. In particular, it appears that desired markups increase in response to increases in demand and fall in response to reductions in demand. Our findings on the state-dependence of price setting are equivocal. We are unable to distinguish between the case of no state dependence and the case of state dependence combined with a unit elasticity of desired markups with respect to exchange rate-driven demand shocks."
Global Business Cycles: Convergence or Decoupling?,IFM,2008,"This paper analyzes the evolution of the degree of global cyclical interdependence over the period 1960-2005. We categorize the 106 countries in our sample into three groups—industrial countries, emerging markets, and other developing economies. Using a dynamic factor model, we then decompose macroeconomic fluctuations in key macroeconomic aggregates—output, consumption, and investment—into different factors. These are: (i) a global factor, which picks up fluctuations that are common across all variables and countries; (ii) three group-specific factors, which capture fluctuations that are common to all variables and all countries within each group of countries; (iii) country factors, which are common across all aggregates in a given country; and (iv) idiosyncratic factors specific to each time series. Our main result is that, during the period of globalization (1985-2005), there has been some convergence of business cycle fluctuations among the group of industrial economies and among the group of emerging market economies. Surprisingly, there has been a concomitant decline in the relative importance of the global factor. In other words, there is evidence of business cycle convergence within each of these two groups of countries but divergence (or decoupling) between them."
How much Cross-Country Risk Sharing do International Financial Markets Provide?,IFM,2008,
International Capital Flows under Dispersed Information: Theory and Evidence,IFM,2008,"We develop a new theory of international capital flows that is based on dispersed information. There is extensive evidence of information heterogeneity within and across countries, which has been critical for understanding asset prices. We analyze the implications for capital flows by introducing information dispersion into an open economy dynamic general equilibrium portfolio choice model. We show that each of the standard elements of portfolio allocation (changes in wealth, expected returns and risk) is affected by dispersed information. We emphasize two implications for both gross and net capital flows: (i) they become partially disconnected from observed macro fundamentals and (ii) they contain information about future macro fundamentals. These implications are confronted to data for industrialized countries."
International Risk Sharing During the Globalization Era,IFM,2008,"In theory, international risk sharing should improve with financial globalization, but existing measures have been unable to detect such improvement. We develop a simple measure of international risk sharing that captures how far countries are from the ideal of perfect risk sharing. Our measure shows that international risk sharing has, indeed, improved during globalization. We also find that improved risk sharing comes mostly from the convergence in consumption growth rates among countries rather than from synchronization of consumption at the business cycle frequency."
Leverage Cycles and The Anxious Economy,IFM,2008,"We provide a pricing theory for emerging asset classes, like Emerging Markets, that are not yet mature enough to be attractive to the general public. We show how leverage cycles can cause contagion, flight to collateral and issuance rationing in a frequently recurring phase we call the anxious economy. Our model provides an explanation for the volatile access of emerging economies to international financial markets and for three stylized facts we identify in emerging markets and high yield data since the late 1990s. Our analytical framework is a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, incomplete markets, and endogenous collateral, plus a new extension encompassing adverse selection."
"Putting the Parts Together: Trade, Vertical Linkages, and Business Cycle Comovement",IFM,2008,"A well established empirical result is that countries that trade more with each other exhibit higher business cycle correlation. This paper examines the mechanisms underlying this relationship using a large cross-country industry-level panel dataset of manufacturing production and trade. We show that higher bilateral trade in an individual sector increases both the co-movement within the sector between trading countries, as well as the comovement between that sector and the rest of the economy of the trading partner. We also demonstrate that vertical linkages in production are an important force behind the overall impact of trade on business cycle synchronization. The elasticity of comovement with respect to bilateral trade is significantly higher in industry pairs that use each other as intermediate inputs in production. Our estimates imply that vertical production linkages account for some 30% of the total impact of bilateral trade on business cycle correlation for our full country sample. Finally, the positive impact of trade on industry-level comovement is far more pronounced in the North-North country pairs compared to either the South-South or North-South country pairs. However, the relative contribution of vertical linkages to aggregate comovement is roughly three times more important for North-South trade than North-North trade."
Understanding International Price Differences using Barcode Data,IFM,2008,"The empirical literature in international finance has produced three key results about international price deviations: borders give rise to flagrant violations of the law of one price, distance matters enormously for understanding these deviations, and most papers find that convergence rates back to purchasing power parity are inconsistent with the evidence of micro studies on nominal price stickiness. The data underlying these results are mostly comprised of price indexes and price surveys of goods that may not be identical internationally. In this paper, we revisit these three stylized facts using massive amounts of US and Canadian data that share a common barcode classification. We find that none of these three main stylized facts survive. We use our barcode level data to replicate prior work and explain what assumptions caused researchers to find different results from those we find in this paper. Overall, our work is supportive of simple pricing models where the degree of market segmentation across the border is similar to that within borders."

Economic Growth and Subjective Well-Being: Reassessing the Easterlin Paradox,ME,2008,"The “Easterlin Paradox” suggests that there is no link between the level of economic development of a society and average levels of happiness. We return to Easterlin’s question: “Will raising the incomes of all increase the happiness of all?” and analyze multiple rich datasets spanning recent decades and a broader array of countries. We establish a clear positive link between GDP and average levels of subjective well-being across countries with no evidence of a satiation point beyond which wealthier countries have no further increases in subjective well-being. Moreover, we show that this relationship is consistent with the relationship between income and happiness within countries, suggesting a minimal role for relative income comparisons as drivers of happiness. Finally, we examine the relationship between changes in subjective well-being and income over time within countries, finding that economic growth has been associated with rising happiness."
Exchange Rates and Producer Prices: Evidence From Micro-Data,ME,2008,"We use a unique data set that matches survey data on domestic and export prices to plant census information to address the following questions.

Frequency of Price Adjustment and Pass-through,ME,2008,"A common finding across empirical studies of price adjustment is that there is large heterogeneity in the frequency of price adjustment. However, there is little evidence of how distant prices are from the desired flexible price. Without this evidence, it is difficult to discern what the frequency measure implies for the transmission of shocks or to understand why some firms adjust more frequently than others. We exploit the open economy environment, which provides a well-identified and sizeable cost shock namely the exchange rate shock to shed light on these questions. First, we empirically document that high frequency adjusters have a long-run pass-through that is at least twice as high as low frequency adjusters in the data. Next, we show theoretically that long-run pass-through is determined by the same primitives that shape the curvature of the profit function and, hence, also affect frequency. In an environment with variable mark-ups or variable marginal costs, theory predicts a positive relation between frequency and pass-through, as documented in the data. Consequently, estimates of long-run pass-through shed light on the determinants of the duration of prices. The standard workhorse model with constant elasticity of demand and Calvo or state dependent pricing generates long-run pass-through that is uncorrelated with frequency, contrary to the data. Lastly, we calibrate a dynamic menu-cost model and show that variable mark-ups chosen to match the variation in pass-through in the data can generate substantial variation in price duration, equivalent to one third of the observed variation in the data."
Household External Finance and Consumption,ME,2008,"This paper uses mortgage data to construct a measure of terms on which households access to external finance, and relates it to consumption at both the aggregate and cohort levels. The Household External Finance (HEF ) index is based on the spread paid by risky borrowers in the mortgage market. There is evidence that the terms of access to external finance matter more for the consumption of young cohorts in U.K. data. Results are robust to a wide variety of specifications."
Identifying Government Spending Shocks: It's All in the Timing,ME,2008,"Do shocks to government spending raise or lower consumption and real wages? Standard VAR identification approaches show a rise in these variables, where as the Ramey-Shapiro narrative identification approach finds a fall. I show that a key difference in the approaches is the timing. Both professional forecasts and the narrative approach shocks Granger-cause the VAR shocks, implying that the VAR shocks are missing the timing of the news. Simulations from a standard neoclassical model in which government spending is anticipated by several quarters demonstrate that VARs estimated with faulty timing can produce a rise in consumption even when it decreases in the model. Finally, I introduce a new variable that is based on narrative evidence that is much richer than the Ramey-Shapiro simple military dates. Shocks to this variable also lead to declines in consumption and real wages."
Insights from an Estimated Search-Based Monetary Model with Nominal Rigidities,ME,2008,"We develop a search-based monetary dynamic stochastic equilibrium (DSGE) model with nominal rigidities by introducing the fundamental frictions that generate money demand in an otherwise standard New-Keynesian DSGE model. We use Bayesian methods to estimate two versions of the model based on post 1983 quarterly U.S. data and compare it to a money-in-the-utility (MIU) specification. While the decentralized market mechanism of the search-based models creates a stronger linkage between technology shocks and fluctuations in the stock of money, this linkage comes at a cost in terms of overall time series fit. On the other hand, if one uses the steady state relationships of the estimated DSGE models to predict velocity in periods of high target inflation rates as observed in the 1970s the search-based models deliver much more realistic predictions than the MIU model. In terms of welfare implications the estimated MIU model behaves very much like a New Keynesian DSGE model and a near-zero inflation rate is optimal. According to the search-based model, which also has embodied the same New Keynesian feature, the Friedman motive for keeping the nominal interest rate near zero dominates and negative inflation rates are optimal."
Investment and Value: A Neoclassical Benchmark,ME,2008,"Which investment model best fits firm-level data? To answer this question we estimate alternative models using Compustat data. Surprisingly, the two best-performing specifications are based on Hayashi’s (1982) model. This model’s foremost implication, that Q is a sufficient statistic for determining a firm’s investment decision, has been often rejected because cash-flow and lagged-investment effects are present in investment regressions. However, we find that these regression are ineffectual for evaluating model performance. So, forget what investment regressions tell you. Models based on Hayashi (1982) provide a very good description of investment behavior at the firm level."
Leveraged Losses: Lessons from the Mortgage Market Meltdown,ME,2008,"This report discusses the implications of the recent financial market turmoil for central banks. We start by characterizing the disruptions in the financial markets and compare these dislocations to previous periods of financial stress. We confirm the conventional view that the current problems in financial markets are concentrated in institutions that have exposure to mortgage securities. We use several methods to estimate the ultimate losses on these securities. Our best (very uncertain) guess is that the losses will total about $400 billion, with about half being borne by leveraged U.S. financial institutions. We then highlight the role of leverage and mark-to-market accounting in propagating this shock. This perspective implies an estimate of the eventual contraction in balance sheets of these institutions, which will include a substantial reduction in credit to businesses and households. We close by exploring the feedback from credit availability to the broader economy and provide new evidence that contractions in financial institutions balance sheets’ cause a reduction in real GDP growth."

Reference Prices and Nominal Rigidities,ME,2008,
The Inflation-Unemployment Trade Off at Low Inflation,ME,2008,"When money-wages cannot fall, wage setters take into account the future consequences of their current choices when optimally setting their wages. Several interesting implications arise. A closed-form solution for a long run Phillips curve relates average unemployment to average wage inflation. The curve is virtually vertical for high inflation rates but becomes flatter as inflation decreases. As macroeconomic volatility shifts the Phillips curve, stabilization policies can play an important role in shaping the trade off. A tendency for upward wage rigidity endogenously arise at low inflation rates, inducing an overall wage rigidity. As a consequence, when inflation decreases, volatility of unemployment increases whereas the volatility of inflation decreases. This implies a long-run trade off also between the volatility of unemployment and volatility of wage inflation."
Can Owning a Home Hedge the Risk of Moving?,PERE,2008,"Conventional wisdom holds that one of the riskiest aspects of owning a house is the uncertainty surrounding its sale price, especially if one moves to another housing market. We show instead that for many households, home owning hedges their net exposure to housing market risk because the sale price is expected to covary with house prices in the likely new markets. That expected covariance is much higher than previously realized because households tend to move between highly correlated housing markets and there is considerable heterogeneity across city pairs in how much house prices covary. Taking these two considerations into account increases the estimated median expected correlation in real house price growth across MSAs from 0.36 to 0.67. Moreover, we show that households’ tenure decision (whether to own or rent) is sensitive to this “moving-hedge” value. We find that the likelihood of home owning is five to 10 percentage points higher for a highly mobile household when the effective covariance between markets rises by 38 percent (one standard deviation). This effect attenuates as a household’s probability of moving diminishes and the hedging value declines."
Did Securitization Lead to Lax Screening? Evidence From Subprime Loans,PERE,2008,"Theories of financial intermediation suggest that securitization, the act of converting illiquid loans into liquid securities, could reduce the incentives of financial intermediaries to screen borrowers. We empirically examine this question using a unique dataset on securitized subprime mortgage loan contracts in the United States. We exploit a specific rule of thumb in the lending market to generate an exogenous variation in ease of securitization and compare the composition and performance of lenders’ portfolios around the ad-hoc threshold. Conditional on being securitized, the portfolio that is more likely to be securitized defaults by around 20% more than a similar risk profile group with a lower probability of securitization. Crucially, these two portfolios have similar observable risk characteristics and loan terms. Since our findings are conditional on securitization, we conduct additional analyses to address selection on the part of borrowers, lenders, or investors as explanations. Our results suggest that securitization does adversely affect the screening incentives of lenders."
Do Local Economic Development Programs Work? Evidence from the Federal EmpowermentZone Program,PERE,2008,"This paper evaluates the impact of Round I of the federal urban Empowerment Zone (EZ) program on neighborhood level labor and housing market outcomes over the period 1994-2000. Using four decades of Census data in conjunction with information on the proposed boundaries of rejected EZs, we find that neighborhoods receiving EZ designation experienced substantial improvements in labor market conditions and moderate increases in rents relative to rejected and future zones. These effects were accompanied by small changes in the demographic composition of the neighborhoods, though evidence from disaggregate Census tabulations suggests that these changes account for little of the observed improvements."
Does It Pay to Read Junk Mail? Evidence of the Effect of Advertising on Home Equity Credit Choices,PERE,2008,"We examine the effect of direct mail (commonly referred to as junk mail) advertising on individual financial decisions by studying consumer choice of home equity debt contracts. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, we find that financial variables underlying the relative pricing of  debt contracts are the leading factors explaining consumers home equity debt choice. Furthermore, we also find that the intended use of debt proceeds significantly impacts consumer choice. However, when we study a subset of consumers who received a direct mail solicitation for a particular debt contract (fixed versus adjustable-rate), we find evidence that the relative pricing variables are less revelent in explaining consumer contract choice, even though they were presented with a full menu of debt contracts. Thus, our results are consistent with the persuasive view of advertising."
Entry and Inefficiency in the Real Estate Brokerage Industry: Empirical Evidence and Policy Implications,PERE,2008,"This paper studies entry in local real estate brokerage to investigate sources of potential cost inefficiency under free entry. Building upon recent empirical work on games of incomplete information, we construct a structural entry model and estimate the model using nested pseudo likelihood algorithms. Using data from 5% PUMS in 2000, we find direct evidence for two sources of cost inefficiency – wasteful non-price competition and loss of economies of scale. Using our estimates, we further investigate welfare implications of prohibiting rebates on commissions and the diffusion of the Internet. We find that rebate bans are welfare-reducing, not only because they discourage price competition from discount brokers, but also because they encourage excessive entry by traditional full-commission brokers. Removing these rebate bans would decrease the equilibrium number of realtors by 5.8% and reduce total variable costs by 3.9%. Welfare implications of the Internet diffusion are mixed, however. An increase in the number of Internet adopters alone could encourage traditional brokers’ entry by helping them reach and match potential clients. However, a commensurate increase in online search intensity among the Internet adopters may discourage such entry by facilitating the development of alternative brokerage models, such as discount brokerage and FSBOs."
"Home Price Risk, Local Market Shocks, and Index Hedging",PERE,2008,"All real estate markets are local, or so the conventional wisdom goes. But just how local is local? I address this question empirically using over 75,000 repeat sales transactions for homes from a large suburban county of Washington D.C.. I frame the analysis in terms of home price risk and index hedging, and I attempt to answer two key questions in this regard. The first is to determine at what level home price shocks occur; i.e., how local are housing markets? The second is to estimate how much homeowners would be willing to pay for access to home price index markets various local levels, which would permit hedging the local components of home price risk. I construct and evaluate a variety of local real estate indices that group homes by district, zip code, home type, and price band, and I calculate several ”house-specific” indices using locally weighted regressions across these variables. Local indices are advantageous relative to metro-level indices for two reasons: (1) they capture local shocks that do not appear in the broader market indices (so they permit homeowners to hedge a larger portion of their basis risk), and (2) they permit hedging of price changes which are relevant to the large fraction of moves that occur within metropolitan areas. I estimate that local market indices explain 3-7% more of the variation in home price shocks than is explained by a city index, depending on the time interval between sales. A typical homeowner would be willing to pay 5-10% more to hedge with a local index compared to a city index, and homeowners anticipating local moves would be willing to pay as much as 25% more."
Illiquid Housing as Self-Insurance: The Case of Long-Term Care,PERE,2008,"Long-term care is one of the few observable triggers for home sale among the elderly. Combined with a thin reverse mortgage market, this helps rationalize weak demand for long-term care insurance (LTCI). Home equity tapped in the event of long-term  care reduces the gain to insurance transfers from healthy states, in which home equity typically goes unspent. The Health and Retirement Study provides empirical evidence supporting this mechanism. Households exposed to large increases in home equity in the recent housing boom were relatively unlikely to add LTCI coverage and relatively likely to drop coverage."
On Local Housing Supply Elasticity,PERE,2008,"Housing markets have been established as fundamental to understanding business cycles, financial market stability, labor mobility, household wealth, individual portfolio allocation, and urban dynamics. What determines local housing supply elasticities and prices? In this paper I give empirical content to the concept of land availability by processing satellite-generated data on elevation and presence of water bodies to precisely estimate the amount of developable land in each metro area. I demonstrate that development is effectively curtailed by the presence of slopes above 15% and that most areas that are widely regarded as supply-inelastic are, in fact, severely land-constrained by their topography. Furthermore, the extent of topographical constraints correlates positively and strongly with regulatory barriers to development. Immigration, high taxes, politics, and “communitarian” social capital are also predictive of more restrictive residential land regulations. I estimate a system of equations where housing prices, construction, and regulations are all determined endogenously. Housing supply elasticities can be well-characterized as functions of both physical and regulatory constraints, which in turn are endogenous to prices and past growth. The results provide operational estimates of local supply elasticities in all major US metropolitan areas."

Inside and Outside Liquidity,RISK; AP,2008,"We consider a model of liquidity demand arising from maturity mismatch on one side of the market. This demand can be met with either the cash held by those with the liquidity need, what we refer to as inside liquidity, or alternatively via asset sales. In this latter case then assets are exchanged for the cash held by agents other than those with these liquidity needs. We refer to this cash as outside liquidity. The questions we address are: (a) what determines the mix of inside and outside liquidity in equilibrium? (b) does the market provide an efficient mix of inside versus inside liquidity? and (c) if not, what kind of interventions can be proposed to restore efficiency? We argue that a key determinant of the aforementioned mix is the timing of the liquidation decision. An important source of inefficiency is the presence of asymmetric information about asset values, which increases the longer a liquidity trade is delayed. We establish that an immediate-trading equilibrium always exists, where liquidity trading occurs in anticipation of a liquidity shock. Another, delayed-trading equilibrium, in which liquidity trading is a response to a liquidity shock, may also exist. We show that, when it exists, the delayed-trading equilibrium is efficient, despite the presence of adverse selection."
Parameter Uncertainty and the Credit Risk of Collateralized Debt Obligations,RISK; AP,2008,"This paper examines the empirical difficulties inherent in assessing the credit quality of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Because of the way CDO liabilities are structured, CDO note payouts are sensitive to tail collateral loss events. As a result, in order to assess the likelihood and severity of a CDO note’s losses, one needs to know the distribution of losses for each collateral asset, as well as the dependence of losses across collateral assets. In practice, CDO collateral losses are most commonly modeled using normal copulas. I show that for more senior CDO tranches, standard credit risk metrics such as probability of default, expected loss, and conditional expected loss are highly sensitive to model parameters that are not directly observable. Given assumptions about the historical data available to a credit analyst, I compute bounds on the accuracy of normal copula parameter estimators and show that in applied settings data constraints are likely to impose severe limitations on an analyst’s ability to accurately evaluate CDO tranches. Thus, CDO note credit ratings should be viewed as more preliminary and less informative than comparable corporate bond ratings."
Risk Spillovers of Financial Institutions,RISK; AP,2008,"This paper uses quantile regressions to document risk spillovers, the increase in financial institutions’ Value-at-Risk (VaR) when other institutions are under distress. We also find that distress in hedge fund sector predicts a higher VaR for investment banks in the subsequent month. We identify six common factors  that explain the risk spillovers across institutions. This set of risk factors also explains a large part of financial institutions’ average returns."

The Long-Run Risks Model and Aggregate Asset Prices: An Empirical Assessment,AP,2009,"The long-run risks model of asset prices explains stock price variation as a response to persistent fluctuations in the mean and volatility of aggregate consumption growth, by a representative agent with a high elasticity of intertemporal substitution. This paper documents several empirical difficulties for the model as calibrated by Bansal and Yaron (BY, 2004) and Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (BKY, 2007a). BY's calibration counterfactually implies that long-run consumption and dividend growth should be highly persistent and predictable from stock prices. BKY's calibration does better in this respect by greatly increasing the persistence of volatility fluctuations and their impact on stock prices. This calibration fits the predictive power of stock prices for future consumption volatility, but implies much greater predictive power of stock prices for future stock return volatility than is found in the data. Neither calibration can explain why movements in real interest rates do not generate strong predictable movements in consumption growth. Finally, the long-run risks model implies extremely low yields and negative term premia on inflation-indexed bonds."

A Leverage-Based Model of Speculative Bubbles,EFCE,2009,"This paper explores whether various credit market interventions can give rise to or rule out the possibility of speculative bubbles. As in previous work by Allen and Gorton (1993) and Allen and Gale (2000), a bubble can occur in my model because traders purchase assets with funds borrowed from creditors who cannot monitor those to whom they lend. This paper adds to this literature by allowing creditors and traders to enter into more general contracts, and by allowing dynamic considerations to affect both contracting and trading strategies. The model suggests that limiting the use of exotic loan contracts need not rule out bubbles, and that the existence of a bubble hinges not on how low short-term rates fall during a monetary expansion but on where rates are expected to settle subsequently."
Asset-Price Channels and Macroeconomic Fluctuations,EFCE,2009,We construct and estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogenous agents and credit constraints. We argue that a financial multiplier can be effective in transforming economic shocks into the observed fluctuations in aggregate output only if the model can generate large fluctuations in asset prices. Our estimation shows that the housing demand shock in our model not only accounts for most of the observed fluctuations in the land price but also contributes to 35 − 45% of investment fluctuations at business cycle frequencies. Such dynamic interactions between land prices and investment movements are the key to our finding of the empirically important amplification and propagation operating through endogenous credit constraints.
Conventional and Unconventional Monetary Policy,EFCE,2009,"We extend the basic (representative-household) New Keynesian [NK] model of the monetary transmission mechanism to allow for a spread between the interest rate available to savers and borrowers, that can vary for either exogenous or endogenous reasons. We find that the mere existence of a positive average spread makes little quantitative difference for the predicted effects of particular policies. Variation in spreads over time is of greater significance, with consequences both for the equilibrium relation between the policy rate and aggregate expenditure and for the relation between real activity and inflation. Nonetheless, we find that the target criterion – a linear relation that should be maintained between the inflation rate and changes in the output gap — that characterizes optimal policy in the basic NK model continues to provide a good approximation to optimal policy, even in the presence of variations in credit spreads. Such a “flexible inflation target” can be implemented by a central-bank reaction function that is similar to a forward-looking Taylor rule, but that includes an adjusted for changes in current and expected future credit spreads. The implications for policy are thus similar in spirit to the kind of spread-adjusted Taylor rule proposed by Taylor (2008) and McCulley and Toloui (2008)."
"Financial Frictions, Financial Integration and The International Propagation of Shocks",EFCE,2009,"This paper develops a quantitative two-country model with a financial accelerator and endogenous portfolio choice to study how the international transmission of asymmetric shocks is affected in the presence of levered cross-border investors. Foreign exposure in interconnected balance sheets of financially constrained investors can indeed act as a powerful propagation mechanism of asymmetric shocks across countries. However, in the model financial and real interdependence can be very strong even with minimal balance sheet exposure, if financial markets are integrated, reflecting a strong pressure towards the cross-border equalization of external finance premia faced by levered investors. In turn, this may result in tight linkages in leverage and macroeconomic dynamics across countries."
Measuring Oil-price Shocks Using Market-based Information,EFCE,2009,"We study the effects of oil-price shocks on the U.S economy combining narrative and quantitative approaches. After examining daily oil-related events since 1984, we classify them into various event types. We then develop measures of exogenous shocks that avoid endogeneity and predictability concerns. Estimation results indicate that oil-price shocks have had substantial and statistically significant effects during the last 25 years. In contrast, traditional VAR approaches imply much weaker and insignificant effects for the same period. This discrepancy stems from the inability of VARs to separate exogenous oil-supply shocks from endogenous oil-price fluctuations driven by changes in oil demand."
Noisy Business Cycles,EFCE,2009,
Pitfalls in Estimating Asymmetric Effects of Energy Price Shocks,EFCE,2009,"A common view in the literature is that the effect of energy price shocks on macroeconomic aggregates is asymmetric in energy price increases and decreases. We show that widely used asymmetric vector autoregressive models of the transmission of energy price shocks are misspecified, resulting in inconsistent parameter estimates, and that the implied impulse responses have been routinely computed incorrectly. As a result, the quantitative importance of unanticipated energy price increases for the U.S. economy has been exaggerated. In response to this problem, we develop alternative regression models and methods of computing responses to energy price shocks that yield consistent estimates regardless of the degree of asymmetry. We also introduce improved tests of the null hypothesis of symmetry in the responses to energy price increases and decreases. An empirical study reveals little evidence against the null hypothesis of symmetry in the responses to energy price shocks. Our analysis also has direct implications for the theoretical literature on the transmission of energy price shocks and for the debate about policy responses to energy price shocks."
Potential and Natural Output,EFCE,2009,
Really Uncertain Business Cycles,EFCE,2009,"We propose uncertainty shocks as an additional impulse driving business cycles. First, we demonstrate that uncertainty, measured by a number of proxies, appears to be strongly countercyclical. When uncertainty is included in a standard vector autoregression, increases in uncertainty lead to a large drop and subsequent rebound in economic activity. Second, we build a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that extends the benchmark neoclassical growth model along two dimensions. It allows for the existence of heterogeneous firms with non-convex adjustment costs in both capital and labor, as well as time-variation in uncertainty that is modeled as a change in the variance of innovations to productivity. We find that increases in uncertainty lead to large drops in economic activity. This occurs because a rise in uncertainty makes firms cautious, leading them to pause hiring and investment, and reduces the reallocation of capital and labor across firms, leading to a large fall in productivity growth. Finally, we show that uncertainty significantly reduces the response of the economy to stimulative policy, relative to its response during low uncertainty periods. This implies that in order for policy during high uncertainty periods to have the same effect it would as under low  uncertainty periods, the policy impulse should be significantly larger and temporary."
The Bond Premium in a DSGE Model with Long-Run Real and Nominal Risks,EFCE,2009,"The term premium on nominal long-term bonds in the standard dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model used in macroeconomics is far too small and stable relative to empirical measures obtained from the data— an example of the “bond premium puzzle.” However, in models of endowment economies, researchers have been able to generate reasonable term premiums by assuming that investors have recursive Epstein-Zin preferences and face long-run economic risks. We show that introducing Epstein-Zin preferences into a canonical DSGE model can also produce a large and variable term premium without compromising the model’s ability to fit key macroeconomic variables. Long-run real and nominal risks further improve the model’s ability to fit the data with a lower level of household risk aversion."
The Effects of Foreign Shocks When US Interest Rates are at Zero,EFCE,2009,"This paper uses a two country DSGE model to show that the effects of an adverse foreign demand shock on the United States are greatly amplified if U.S. monetary policy is constrained from reducing nominal interest rates for a protracted period. In particular, a shock that causes foreign GDP to decline 1 percent causes U.S. output to fall about 0.8 percent in our benchmark specification in which the United States is mired in a liquidity trap, compared with the 0.3 percent fall that occurs in the normal situation in which the United States can freely adjust policy rates. This amplification in the presence of the binding zero bound constraint occurs because U.S. domestic demand contracts in response to higher real interest rates rise, in sharp contrast to the “textbook” implications of a negative external demand shock when policy rates can be freely adjusted."

Banking Crises and Crises Dating: Theory and Evidence,EFEL,2009,"We analyze the effect of financial integration on the degree of business cycle synchronization, using a confidential dataset on banks' international bilateral exposure over the past three decades in a panel of twenty developed countries. Financial integration is associated with less synchronized output cycles, in line with the standard theories of output fluctuations. We employ two distinct instrumental variable specifications to identify the one-way effect of integration on synchronization. These specifications reveal that the component of banking integration predicted by legislative-regulatory harmonization policies and the nature of the bilateral exchange rate regime has a negative effect on output synchronization. Our results contrast with those of the cross-sectional studies that show an increase in the degree of business cycles synchronization as a result of financial integration. We reconcile the different results by showing that the cross-sectional estimates suffer from omitted-variable bias."
Bursting Bubbles: Consequences and Cures,EFEL,2009,
Capital Structure Dynamics and Transitory Debt,EFEL,2009,"We estimate a dynamic capital structure model in which firms have permanent leverage targets, yet respond to shocks to investment opportunities by incurring transitory debt obligations that represent deliberate, but temporary, deviations from target. The model yields a variety of testable predictions about the link between capital structure and attributes of firms’ investment opportunities, including the volatility and serial correlation of investment opportunity shocks, the marginal profitability of investment, and the nature of capital stock adjustment costs. Target capital structures reflect the value of the option to issue transitory debt, and the average outstanding amount of debt differs predictably from target because the optimal leverage path reflects time-varying (and state-contingent) transitory debt, whose usage is determined by the firm-specific properties of current and prospective shocks to investment opportunities. Sluggish mean reversion in leverage reflects the opportunity cost of utilizing debt capacity, and not transactions costs of debt issuance, which are zero in our model."
"Confidence, Crashes and Animal Spirits",EFEL,2009,This paper argues that the equilibrium business cycle theory which has guided macroeconomics for the past thirty five years is flawed. I introduce an alternative paradigm that retains the main message of Keynes’ General Theory and which reconciles that message with Walrasian economics. I argue that there are two market failures in the labor market: A lemons problem and an externality. I show how those two problems lead to inefficient equilibria in which the unemployment rate is determined by the self-fulfilling beliefs of stock market participants.

Entrepreneurial Finance and Non-diversifiable Risk,EFEL,2009,
Financial Integration and Business Cycle Synchronization,EFEL,2009,"Entrepreneurs face significant non-diversifiable business risks. We build a dynamic incomplete-markets model of entrepreneurial finance to demonstrate the important implications of non-diversifiable risks for entrepreneurs’ interdependent consumption, portfolio allocation, financing, investment, and business exit decisions. The optimal capital structure is determined by a generalized tradeoff model where leverage via risky non-recourse debt provides significant diversification benefits. More risk-averse entrepreneurs default earlier, but also choose higher leverage, even though leverage makes his equity more risky. Non-diversified entrepreneurs demand both systematic and idiosyncratic risk premium. Cash-out option and external equity further improve diversification and raise the entrepreneur’s valuation of the firm. Finally, entrepreneurial risk aversion can overturn the risk-shifting incentives induced by risky debt."

"Securitization, Transparency and Liquidity",EFEL,2009,"We present a model in which issuers of structured bonds choose to release coarse information to enhance the liquidity of their primary market, at the cost of reducing secondary market liquidity or even causing it to freeze. The degree of transparency is inefficiently low if the social value of secondary market liquidity exceeds its private value. We analyze various types of public intervention – mandatory transparency standards, provision of liquidity to distressed banks or secondary market price support – and find that they have quite different welfare implications. Finally, transparency is greater if issuers restrain the issue size, or tranche it so as to sell the more information-sensitive tranche to sophisticated investors only."
The Cyclical Component of US Asset Returns,EFEL,2009,
"Why Don't Lenders Renegotiate More Home Mortgages? Redefaults, Self-Cures and Securitization",EFEL,2009,"We document the fact that servicers have been reluctant to renegotiate mortgages since the foreclosure crisis started in 2007, having performed payment reducing modifications on only about 3 percent of seriously delinquent loans. We show that this reluctance does not result from securization: servicers renegotiate similarly small fractions of loans that they hold in their portfolios. Our results are robust to different definitions of renegotiation, including the one most likely to be affected by securitization, and to different definitions of delinquency. Our results are strongest in subsamples in which unobserved heterogeneity between portfolio and securitized loans is likely to be small and for subprime loans. We use a theoretical model to show that redefault risk, the possibility that a borrower will still default despite costly renegotiation, and self-cure risk, the possibility that a seriously delinquent borrower will become current without renegotiation, make renegotiation unattractive to investors."
Altruistic Dynamic Pricing with Customer Regret,EFHJ,2009,"A model is considered where firms internalize the regret costs that consumers experience when they see an unexpected price change. Regret costs are assumed to be increasing in the size of price changes and this can explain why the size of price increases is less sensitive to inflation than in models with fixed costs of changing prices. The latter predict unrealistically large responses of price changes to inflation for firms that do not frequently reduce their prices. Adjustment costs that depend on the size of price changes also raise the variability on the size of price increases. Lastly, it is argued that the common practice of announcing price increases in advance is much easier to rationalize with regret concerns by consumers than with more standard approaches to price rigidity."
Customer Capital,EFHJ,2009,"Firms spend significant resources on creating and maintaining long-term customer relationships. We explore the role of this customer capital - a form of intangible capital - for firm valuation and physical investment. We build a general equilibrium model of long-term customer relationships, where existing customers are partially locked-in due to frictional product markets, and firms advertise, competing for customers by offering discounts. Calibrating the model, we find that it reproduces the low correlation of investment with Tobin’s Q, and the high correlation of investment with cash flows found in data. Consistent with our model, we find that in the data investment is more correlated with cash flows, and less with Q, in industries where customer capital (as proxied by advertising expenses) is more important."
Estimating the Border Effect: Some New Evidence,EFHJ,2009,
Exchange Rates and Producer Prices: Evidence from Micro Data,EFHJ,2009,"We investigate the role played by pricing-to-market and endogenous price adjustment in explaining exchange rate passthrough. We make use of a producer price data set where we observe the prices charged by plants who produce and sell the same product in home and export markets. We focus on prices invoiced in destination currency. We use a fixed e¤ects strategy to control for marginal cost shocks, and examine price responses to the relative-demand-shifting component of exchange rate changes. We find strong evidence of pricing-to-market: conditioning on price changes in both markets, relative prices move one-for-one with changes in exchange rates. Consistent with this finding, the probability that prices change in one market but not the other does not depend on the size of exchange rate changes. Together, these findings imply zero passthrough of exchange rate changes into export prices at the factory gate when prices are invoiced in destination currency."
Information Constrained State Dependent Pricing,EFHJ,2009,"I present a generalization of the standard (full-information) model of state-dependent pricing in which decisions about when to review a firm's existing price must be made on the basis of imprecise awareness of current market conditions. The imperfect information is endogenized using a variant of the theory of ""rational inattention"" proposed by Sims (1998, 2003, 2006). This results in a one-parameter family of models, indexed by the cost of information, which nests both the standard state-dependent pricing model and the Calvo model of price adjustment as limiting cases (corresponding to a zero information cost and an unboundedly large information cost respectively). For intermediate levels of the information cost, the model is equivalent to a ""generalized Ss model"" with a continuous ""adjustment hazard"" of the kind proposed by Caballero and Engel (1993a, 1993b), but provides an economic motivation for the hazard function and very specific predictions about its form. For high enough levels of the information cost, the Calvo model of price-setting is found to be a reasonable approximation to the exact equilibrium dynamics, except in the case of (infrequent) large shocks. When the model is calibrated to match the frequency and size distribution of price changes observed in microeconomic data sets, prices are found to be much less flexible than in a full-information state-dependent pricing model, and only about 20 percent more flexible than under a Calvo model with the same average frequency of price adjustment.
"
Lost in Transit: Product Replacement Bias and Pricing to Market,EFHJ,2009,"Product replacement is frequent in the micro-data that underlie U.S. import and export price indices. In contrast, price changes are infrequent in these data. In constructing price indices, price adjustments that occur at the time of product replacements tend to be dropped. If price adjustments disproportionately occur at the time of product replacements then price adjustments are disproportionately unobserved. We show that this ""product replacement bias"" has distorted the measured long-run relationship between import and export prices and the exchange rate by a factor of between 1.7 and 2.2. Accounting for this bias, we find that the price of non-oil U.S. imports (relative to domestic consumption) responds by roughly 0.7% for each 1% change in the U.S. real exchange rate, while the price of U.S. exports (relative to foreign consumption) responds by roughly 0.8%. This contrasts with conventional pass-through estimates of 0.2-0.4% for non-oil import prices and 0.9% for export prices. Thus, we find that the degree of pricing to market for U.S. imports and exports is more symmetric and the degree of pricing to market for U.S. imports more moderate than conventional measures suggest. Adjusting for product replacement bias also substantially raises the volatility of the terms of trade. These results improve the fit of the data to standard models."
Reconsidering the Microeconomic Foundations of Price-Setting Behavior,EFHJ,2009,"Although the Dixit-Stiglitz aggregator is the workhorse specification of monopolistic competition, this framework and related variants abstract from a key stylized fact from empirical studies of consumer behavior and product marketing, namely, that the price elasticity of demand for a given brand is primarily determined by the extensive margin (i.e., changes in the number of customers purchasing that product) rather than the intensive margin (i.e.,changes in the specific quantity purchased by each individual customer). In this paper, we begin by analyzing household scanner data to confirm the salient empirical results. We then proceed to formulate a new dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modelling framework that captures both the intensive and extensive margins of demand, and we investigate the implications of this framework under two alternative sources of firm-level heterogeneity. First, in the case of idiosyncratic productivity shocks, we obtain analytic results for consumer demand and firms’ price-setting behavior and we show that the implications of the model are consistent with the key stylized facts. Second, in the case of staggered nominal price contracts, we show that the presence of customer search has important consequences for the welfare costs of inflation variability and hence for the design of monetary policy."
Reset Price Inflation and the Impact of Monetary Policy Shocks,EFHJ,2009,"A standard state-dependent pricing model generates little monetary non-neutrality. Two ways of generating more meaningful real effects are time-dependent pricing and strategic complementarities. These mechanisms have telltale implications for the persistence and volatility of ""reset price inflation."" Reset price inflation is the rate of change of all desired prices (including for goods that have not changed price in the current period). Using the micro data underpinning the CPI, we construct an empirical measure of reset price inflation. We find that time-dependent models imply unrealistically high persistence and stability of reset price inflation. This discrepancy is exacerbated by adding strategic complementarities, even under state-dependent pricing. A state-dependent model with no strategic complementarities aligns most closely with the data."
Some Evidence on the Importance of Sticky Wages,EFHJ,2009,"Nominal wage stickiness is an important component of recent medium-scale structural macroeconomic models, but to date there has been little microeconomic evidence supporting the assumption of sluggish nominal wage adjustment. We present evidence on the frequency of nominal wage adjustment using data from the last two complete panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The SIPP provides high-frequency information on wages, employment and demographic characteristics for a large and representative sample of the US population. The main results of the analysis are as follows. 1) After correcting for measurement error, wages appear to be very sticky. In the average quarter, the probability that an individual will experience a nominal wage change is between 6 and 20 percent, depending on the samples and assumptions used. 2) There is no significant heterogeneity in the frequency of wage adjustment across industries, but there is heterogeneity across occupations when salaried workers are included in the analysis. 3) The frequency of wage adjustment does not display any significant seasonal pattern. 4) The hazard of a nominal wage change first increases and then decreases, with a peak at 12 months. These results are robust to examining wage changes for either hourly or salaried workers, controlling for attrition by using a balanced panel, and varying the degree of correction for measurement error."
Are Macroeconomic Variables Useful for Forecasting the Distribution of U.S. Inflation?,EFWW,2009,"Much of the US inflation forecasting literature deals with examining the ability of macroeconomic indicators to predict the mean of future inflation, and the overwhelming evidence suggests that the macroeconomic indicators provide little or no predictability. In this paper, we expand the scope of inflation predictability and explore whether macroeconomic indicators are useful in predicting the distribution of future inflation. To incorporate macroeconomic indicators into the prediction of the conditional distribution of future inflation, we introduce a semi-parametric approach using conditional quantiles. The approach offers more flexibility in capturing the possible role of macroeconomic indicators in predicting the different parts of the future inflation distribution. Using monthly data on US inflation, we find that unemployment rate, housing starts, and the term spread provide significant out-of-sample predictability for the distribution of core inflation. Importantly, this result is obtained for a forecast evaluation period that we intentionally chose to be after 1984, when current research shows that macroeconomic indicators do not add much to the predictability of the future mean inflation. This paper discusses various findings using forecast intervals and forecast densities, and highlights the unique insights that the distribution approach offers, which otherwise would be ignored if we relied only on mean forecasts."
Dynamic Hierarchical Factor Models,EFWW,2009,"This paper presents a three level dynamic factor model with a block structure that allows us to distinguish series-specific variations from two types of common variations:- those from (level two) factors that are common to units within a block, and those from (level three) factors that are common across blocks. A four-level model is obtained by allowing each block to have subblocks. The model is estimated using an MCMC algorithm that explicitly takes into account the dependence of the lower level factors on the higher level ones. We find that regional variations dominate aggregate level variations in housing prices and that in spite of the attention given to releases of employment data, the aggregate component in the employment block is very small."
Generalized Least Squares Estimation of Panel with Common Shocks,EFWW,2009,"This paper considers GLS estimation of linear panel models when the innovation and the regressors can both contain a factor structure. A novel feature of this approach is that preliminary estimation of the latent factor structure is not necessary. Under a set of regularity conditions here provided, we establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the feasible GLS estimator as both the cross-section and time series dimensions diverge to infinity. Dependence, both temporally and cross-sectionally, of the idiosyncratic innovation is permitted. Our results are presented separately for time regressions with unit-specific coefficients as well as for cross-section regressions with time-specific coefficients. As particular cases of our set up, we establish primitive conditions of our assumptions for Andrews (2005) and Pesaran (2006) regression models. A set of Monte Carlo experiments corroborate our results."

Inflation Compensation and the Macroeconomy: What Drives Break-Even Inflation Rates?,EFWW,2009,"The yield spread between nominal and inflation-linked bonds (break-even inflation rates, BEIR, or inflation compensation) is a fundamental indicator of inflation expectations (and associated premia). This paper investigates the role of several macroeconomic and financial variables as determinants of the BEIR using Bayesian model selection techniques, and documents their explanatory power at di¤erent horizons. At short horizons, current inflation dynamics is the main determinant of the BEIR in the euro area. At long horizons, financial variables (i.e. term spread, bond market volatility) become increasingly relevant, but confidence and cyclical indicators remain important. Real activity, the term spread and the long-term bond yield volatility are important determinants of the US BEIRs at all horizons."
Nested Forecast Model Comparisons: A New Approach to Testing Equal Accuracy,EFWW,2009,"This paper develops bootstrap methods for testing whether, in a finite sample, competing out-of-sample forecasts from nested models are equally accurate. Most prior work on forecast tests for nested models has focused on a null hypothesis of equal accuracy in population | basically, whether coefficients on the extra variables in the larger, nesting model are zero. We instead use an asymptotic approximation that treats the coefficients as non-zero but small, such that, in a finite sample, forecasts from the small model are expected to be as accurate as forecasts from the large model. Under that approximation, we derive the limiting distributions of pairwise tests of equal mean square error, and develop bootstrap methods for estimating critical values. Monte Carlo experiments show that our proposed procedures have good size and power properties for the null of equal finite-sample forecast accuracy. We illustrate the use of the procedures with applications to forecasting stock returns and inflation."
Pre- and Post-Break Parameter Inference,EFWW,2009,This paper discusses inference about the pre and post break value of a scalar parameter in GMM time series models with a single break at an unknown point in time. We show that treating the break date estimated by least squares as the true break date leads to substantially oversized tests and confidence intervals unless the break is large. We develop an alternative test that controls size uniformly and that is approximately efficient in some well defined sense.
Real-Time Inflation Forecasting in a Changing World,EFWW,2009,"This paper revisits inflation forecasting using reduced form Phillips curve forecasts, i.e., inflation forecasts using activity and expectations variables. We propose a Phillips curve-type model that results from averaging across different regression specifications selected from a set of potential predictors. The set of predictors includes lagged values of inflation, a host of real activity data, term structure data, nominal data and surveys. In each of the individual specifications we allow for stochastic breaks in regression parameters, where the breaks are described as occasional shocks of random magnitude. As such, our framework simultaneously addresses structural change and model certainty that unavoidably affects Phillips curve forecasts. We use this framework to describe PCE deflator and GDP deflator inflation rates for the United States across the post-WWII period. Over the full 1960-2008 sample the framework indicates several structural breaks across different combinations of activity measures. These breaks often coincide with, amongst others, policy regime changes and oil price shocks. In contrast to many previous studies, we find less evidence for autonomous variance breaks and inflation gap persistence. Through a real-time out-of-sample forecasting exercise we show that our model specification generally provides superior one-quarter and one-year ahead forecasts for quarterly inflation relative to a whole range of forecasting models that are typically used in the literature."
Should Macroeconomic Forecasters Look at High-Frequency Financial Data?,EFWW,2009,
The Empirical Saddlepoint Likelihood Estimator Applied to Two-Step GMM,EFWW,2009,"The empirical saddlepoint likelihood (ESPL) estimator is introduced. The ESPL provides improvement over one-step GMM estimators by including additional terms to automatically reduce higher order bias. The first order sampling properties are shown to be equivalent to efficient two-step GMM. New tests are introduced for hypothesis on the model's parameters. The higher order bias is calculated and situations of practical interest are noted where this bias will be smaller than for currently available estimators. As an application, the ESPL is used to investigate an overidentified moment model. It is shown how the model's parameters can be estimated with both the ESPL and a conditional ESPL (CESPL), conditional on the overidentifying restrictions being satisfied. This application leads to several new tests for overidentifying restrictions. Simulations demonstrate that ESPL and CESPL have smaller bias than currently available one-step GMM estimators. The simulations also show new tests for overidentifying restrictions that have performance comparable to or better than currently available tests. The computations needed to calculate the ESPL estimator are comparable to those needed for a one-step GMM estimator."
What Happened to the Quants in August 2007? Evidence from Factors and Transactions Data,EFWW,2009,"During the week of August 6, 2007, a number of quantitative long/short equity hedge funds experienced unprecedented losses. It has been hypothesized that a coordinated deleveraging of similarly constructed portfolios caused this temporary dislocation in the market. Using the simulated returns of long/short equity portfolios based on five specific valuation factors, we find evidence that the unwinding of these portfolios began in July 2007 and continued until the end of 2007. Using transactions data, we find that the simulated returns of a simple marketmaking strategy were significantly negative during the week of August 6, 2007, but positive before and after, suggesting that the Quant Meltdown of August 2007 was the combined effects of portfolio deleveraging throughout July and the first week of August, and a temporary withdrawal of marketmaking risk capital starting August 8th. Our simulations point to two unwinds—a mini-unwind on August 1st starting at 10:45am and ending at 11:30am, and a more sustained unwind starting at the open on August 6th and ending at 1:00pm—that began with stocks in the financial sector and long Book-to-Market and short Earnings Momentum. These conjectures have significant implications for the systemic risks posed by the hedge-fund industry."
"Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, and Deviations from Covered Interest Parity",IFM,2009,"We provide robust evidence of a deviation in the Covered Interest Parity (CIP) relation since the onset of the crisis in August 2007. The CIP deviation exists with respect to several different dollar interest rates and exchange rate pairs of the dollar vis-à-vis other currencies. The results show that our proxy for margin conditions and cost of capital are significant determinants of the basis, especially during the crisis period. The supply of dollars by the Federal Reserve to foreign central banks via reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) reduced CIP deviations at this time. Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, counterparty risk became a significant determinant of CIP deviations and the swap lines program no longer affected the CIP deviations. These results indicate a breakdown of arbitrage transactions in the international capital markets partly due to lack of capital and partly due to heightened counterparty credit risk. Central bank interventions helped to reduce the funding liquidity risk of global institutions."
"Financial Innovation, the Discovery of Risk, and the U.S. Credit Crisis",IFM,2009,"Financial innovation and uncertainty about the true riskiness of new financial products were important factors behind the U.S. financial crisis. We show that a sharp boom-bust cycle in credit and macroeconomic aggregates characterizes the dynamics that follow the introduction of debt securitization, in a setup in which agents learn about the true riskiness of the new financial environment over time. Early positive outcomes that feature high ability to securitize debt lead agents to turn overly optimistic about the probability of persistence of the regime with high securitization. In response, they borrow and increase leverage more than they would under rational expectations based on knowledge of the true probabilities of switching across high and low securitization regimes. When agents first observe that their ability to securitize debt can actually decline, they respond with sharp downward adjustments in credit and consumption. Over-borrowing generated by optimism accounts for roughly one quarter of the secular decline in net credit assets of U.S. nonfinancial sectors observed between 1983-2006."

"How Do Different Exporters React to Exchange Rate Changes? Theory, Empirics, and Aggregate Implications",IFM,2009,"This paper analyzes the reaction of exporters to exchange rate changes. We show that, in the presence of distribution costs in the export market, high and low productivity firms react differently to a depreciation . Whereas high productivity firms optimally raise their markup rather than the volume they export, low productivity firms choose the opposite strategy. This heterogeneity has important consequences for the aggregate impact of exchange rate movements. The presence of fixed costs to export means that only high productivity firms can export, firms which precisely react to an exchange rate depreciation by increasing their export price rather than their sales. We show that this selection effect can explain the weak impact of exchange rate movements on aggregate export volumes. We then test the main predictions of the model on a very rich French firm level data set with destination-specific export values and volumes on the period 1995-2005. Our results confirm that high performance firms react to a depreciation by increasing their export price rather than their export volume. The reverse is true for low productivity exporters. Pricing to market by exporters is also more pervasive in sectors and destination countries with higher distribution costs. Another result consistent with our theoretical framework is that the probability of firms to enter the export market following a depreciation increases. The extensive margin response to exchange rate changes is modest at the aggregate level because firms that enter, following a depreciation, are less productive and smaller relative to existing firms."
Immigration and the Macroeconomy,IFM,2009,"We analyze the dynamics of labor migration and the insurance role of remittances in a two-country, real business cycle framework. Emigration increases with the expected stream of future wage gains, but is dampened by the sunk cost reflecting border enforcement. During booms in the destination economy, the scarcity of established immigrants lessens capital accumulation, labor productivity and the native wage. The welfare gain from the inflow of unskilled labor increases with the complementarity between skilled and unskilled labor, and with the share of the skilled  among native labor. The model matches the cyclical dynamics of the unskilled immigration from Mexico."
"International Portfolios, Capital Accumulation, and Foreign Asset Dynamics",IFM,2009,"Despite the liberalization of capital flows among OECD countries, equity home bias remains sizable. We depart from the two familiar explanations of equity home bias: transaction costs that impede international diversification, and terms of trade responses to supply shocks that provide risk sharing, so that there is little incentive to hold diversified portfolios. We show that the interaction of the following ingredients generates a realistic equity home bias: capital accumulation and international trade in stocks and bonds. In our model, domestic stocks are used to hedge fluctuations in local wage income. Terms of trade risk is hedged using bonds denominated in local goods and in foreign goods. In contrast to related models, the low level of international diversification does not depend on strongly counter-cyclical terms of trade. The model also reproduces the cyclical dynamics of foreign asset positions and of international capital flows."
On the Sources of Aggregate Fluctuations in Emerging Economies,IFM,2009,"Recent research on macroeconomic fluctuations in emerging economies has resulted in two leading approaches: introducing a stochastic productivity trend, in addition to the temporary productivity shocks; or allowing for foreign interest rate shocks coupled with financial frictions. This paper compares the two approaches empirically, taking  advantage of recent developments in the theory and implementation of Bayesian methods. Our model comparison exercises favor models with financial frictions over the stochastic trend model. Our results are inconclusive in terms of which of the financial frictions we consider, working capital versus endogenous spreads, is a superior choice. Finally, a model that allows for both stochastic trends and financial frictions assign a substantial role to interest rate shocks, but not to trend shocks, in generating aggregate fluctuations."
Optimal Policy with Occasionally Binding Credit Constraints,IFM,2009,"We study optimal policy in a small-open economy in which a foreign borrowing constraint binds occasionally. In the model that we set up scope for policy arises because of the pecuniary externality stemming from the presence of a key relative price in the borrowing constraint. The objective of the paper is to characterize an optimal policy rule for both crisis periods when the borrowing constraints binds (i.e., sudden stops), and for periods of relative tranquility in which the constraint does not bind (i.e., normal times). That is, should the government intervene before the constraint actually binds? Or does the optimal policy have a precautionary component? In the model, the policy instrument is a distortionary tax on consumption of non-tradable goods that affects their relative price and can be interpreted as an intervention to affect the real exchange rate. We find that the optimal policy is non-linear. If the constraint is not binding, the optimal tax rate is zero, as in an economy without credit constraint, and hence there is no precautionary component in the optimal policy or intervention on the real exchange rate in normal times. If the constraint is binding, the optimal policy is to intervene aggressively by subsidizing the consumption of non-tradable goods. The decrease in precautionary saving induced by such a policy is quantitatively small, but this does not necessarily imply a small welfare impact of the optimal policy"
Order Flows and the Exchange Rate Disconnect Puzzle,IFM,2009,"The aim of this paper is to establish the link between the high frequency dynamics of spot exchange rates and developments in the macroeconomy. To do so, I first present a theoretical model of exchange-rate determination that bridges the gap between existing microstructure and traditional models. The model examines how dispersed microeconomic information known to individual agents outside the foreign exchange market is aggregated and transmitted to dealers via transaction flows (i.e., order flow); and how the information is then embedded in the spot exchange rate. I then report empirical evidence that strongly supports the presence of the link between the macroeconomy, order flow, and high frequency exchange rate returns implied by the model. In fact, my empirical results indicate that between 20 and 30 percent of the variance in excess currency returns over one- and two-month horizons can be linked back to developments in the macroeconomy. This level of explanatory power is an order of magnitude higher than that found in traditional models — even the newly developed monetary models incorporating central banks reaction functions. Moreover, it provides a straightforward solution to the exchange-rate disconnect puzzle. Namely, the high frequency behavior of spot exchange rates reflects the flow of new information reaching dealers concerning the slowly evolving state of the macroeconomy, rather than the effects of shocks that drive rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions."
Taylor Rules and the Euro,IFM,2009,"This paper uses real-time data to show that inflation and either the output gap or unemployment, the variables which normally enter central banks’ Taylor rules for interest-rate-setting, can provide evidence of out-of-sample predictability and forecasting ability for the United States Dollar/Euro exchange rate from the inception of the Euro in 1999 to the end of 2007. We also present less formal evidence that, with real-time data, the Taylor rule provides a better description of ECB than of Fed policy during this period. The strongest evidence is found for specifications that neither incorporate interest rate smoothing nor include the real exchange rate in the forecasting regression, and the results are robust to whether or not the coefficients on inflation and the real economic activity measure are constrained to be the same for the U.S. and the Euro Area. The evidence is stronger with inflation forecasts than with inflation rates and with real-time data than with revised data. Bad news about inflation and good news about real economic activity both lead to out-of-sample predictability and forecasting ability through forecasted exchange rate appreciation."
Technology Shocks: Novel Implications for International Business Cycles,IFM,2009,"Understanding the joint dynamics of international prices and quantities remains a central issue in international business cycles. International relative prices appreciate when domestic consumption and output increase more than their foreign counterparts. In addition, both trade ows and trade prices display sizable volatility. This paper incorporates Hicks-neutral and investment-specific technology shocks into a standard two-country general equilibrium model with variable capacity utilization and weak wealth effects on labor supply. Investment-specific technology shocks introduce a source of uctuations in absorption similar to taste shocks, thus reconciling theory and data. The paper also presents implications for the trans-mission mechanism of technology shocks across countries and for the Barro and King (1984) critique of investment shocks."
The Competitive Saving Motive: Evidence from Rising Sex Ratios and Savings Rates in China,IFM,2009,"While the high savings rate in China has global impact, existing explanations are incomplete. This paper proposes a competitive saving motive as a new explanation: as the country experiences a rising sex ratio imbalance, the increased competition in the marriage market has induced the Chinese, especially parents with a son, to postpone consumption in favor of wealth accumulation. The pressure on savings spills over to other households through higher costs of house purchases. Both cross-regional and household-level evidence support this hypothesis. This factor can potentially account for about 48% of the actual increase in the household savings rate during 1990-2007."
"Watch What I Do, Not What I Say: The Unintended Consequences of the Homeland Investment Act",IFM,2009,"This paper analyzes the impact on firm behavior of the Homeland Investment Act of 2004, which provided a one-time tax holiday for the repatriation of foreign earnings by U.S. multinationals. The analysis controls for endogeneity and omitted variable bias by using instruments that identify the firms likely to receive the largest tax benefits from the holiday. Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D—even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions and for firms that appeared to be financially constrained. Instead, a $1 increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of almost $1 in payouts to shareholders. These results suggest that the domestic operations of U.S. multinationals were not financially constrained and that these firms were reasonably well-governed. The results have important implications for understanding the impact of U.S. corporate tax policy on multinational firms."
What Do International Asset Returns Imply about Consumption Risk Sharing?,IFM,2009,"An extensive literature has examined the potential risk-sharing gains from international diversification by focusing on models and data based upon consumption relationships across countries. These consumption-based studies have largely ignored the implications of the models for asset pricing moments, leading to counterfactual asset pricing relationships such as low equity  premia, high risk free rates, and low volatility of asset returns. These counterfactual predictions in asset returns cast doubt on the ability of the literature to accurately measure gains from risk-sharing. In this paper, we begin to bridge this disconnect in the literature. We first show how the use of key preference parameters affect both asset return moments and risk-sharing measures. We then use asset return moments to discipline our parameter estimates. Based upon these estimates, we re-examine the gains from international consumption risk-sharing."

Capital Subsidies and Agglomeration Economies: Evidence from Brazilian Cities,PERE,2009,"This paper examines how the privatization of state-owned banks and the elimination of capital subsidies to small cities in Brazil result in a reallocation of economic activity away from small cities and in favor of large cities. It assesses how state-bank privatization affects lending in privatizing cities and how firms and workers adjust to changes in the availability of credit. After state banks are privatized, small privatizing cities lose capital, firms, and high-skilled employment, but gain low-skilled employment. Large privatizing cities gain capital, firms, and both high-skilled and low-skilled employment. The increase in low-skilled employment in both small and large privatizing cities is consistent with a theory where low-skilled labor and capital are relative substitutes and high-skilled labor and capital are relative complements. In non-privatizing cities, where state-bank privatization does not occur, there is little change in capital, firms, and employment relative to previous trends. This provides a counterfactual for what would have occurred in privatizing cities if state banks had not been privatized. The de-industrialization and reallocation of economic activity away from small privatizing cities once capital subsidies are eliminated suggest that even decades of subsidized capital may not have been sufficient to create lasting agglomeration economies."

The Micro-Empirics of Collective Action: The Case of Business Improvement Districts,PERE,2009,"This paper carries out a micro-level analysis of collective goods provision by focusing on the formation of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs). The paper‟s theoretical and empirical analysis is unusually complete in that it considers the entire process of collective action, including participation in initial organization, voting, and ultimate impacts on property values. BID benefits are shown to be highly uneven, and BID formation is not a Pareto improvement. Furthermore, larger “anchor participants” benefit disproportionately, and are crucial for the viability of the institution, consistent with Olson (1965). These results, while demonstrated in a particular setting, apply to collective action more generally. Whenever a market failure leaves room for a collective response, the presence of anchor participants encourages collective action, and the action -- even though in a sense voluntary -- has uneven benefits."
Do Financial Counseling Mandates Improve Mortgage Choice and Performance? Evidence from a Legislative Experiment,RISK,2009,"We explore the effects of mandatory third-party review of mortgage contracts on the terms, availability, and performance of mortgage credit. Our study is based on a legislative experiment in which the State of Illinois required ‘high-risk’ mortgage applicants acquiring or refinancing properties in 10 specific zip codes to submit loan offers from state-licensed lenders to review by HUD-certified financial counselors. We document that the legislation led to declines in both the supply of and demand for credit, with state-licensed lenders and lower-quality borrowers disproportionately exiting the affected area. Controlling for the salient characteristics of the remaining borrowers and lenders, we find that the legislation succeeded in reducing ex post default rates among counseled borrowers by 3 to 4 percentage points (about 30% decline). We attribute this result to actions of lenders responding to the presence of external review and, to a lesser extent, to counseled borrowers renegotiating their loan terms. We also find that the legislation nudged some borrowers to choose less risky loan products in order to avoid counseling."
Does a Central Clearing Counterparty Reduce Counterparty Risk?,RISK,2009,"We show whether adding a central clearing counterparty (CCP) for a particular asset class, such as credit derivatives, improves the efficiency of counterparty risk mitigation  and collateral demands, relative to bilateral netting between pairs of dealers. We show that, for plausible cases, adding a CCP for one class of derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS) can actually reduce netting efficiency and thereby lead to an increase in collateral demands and average exposure to counterparty default. We also show that whenever it is efficient to introduce a central clearing counterparty, it cannot be efficient to introduce more than one CCP for the same class of derivatives."
Fear of Fire Sales and the Credit Freeze,RISK,2009,"In early 2009, the supply of credit in industrial countries appeared to decline. Could this be because bank balance sheets were “clogged” with illiquid securities? If so, why did banks not attempt to sell them? We argue that an “overhang” of impaired banks that may be forced to sell soon can reduce the current price of illiquid securities sufficiently that banks have no interest in selling. This creates high expected returns to holding cash for potential buyers and an aversion to making term loans. We discuss the implications for policies to clean up the banking system during a financial crisis."

Liquidity and Financial Intermediation,RISK,2009,"In this paper, we examine how liquidity premia are affected by the supplies of various types of assets. Specifically, we examine how the supply of government debt affects the real interest rate and the liquidity premium in the economy. More importantly, we examine how the financial sector satisfies the demand for liquidity by transforming illiquid assets into liquid assets, and thereby how the private supply of liquid assets is affected by the supply of government debt. We also show that a rise in uncertainty (i.e., risk premia) hampers the ability of financial institutions to provide liquid assets, and hence may lead to a contraction in the supply of liquid assets in addition to a rise in the liquidity premium. Hence, this paper establishes a close connection between risk premia and liquidity premia. This feature arises naturally out of our model, and as well seems to be a reasonable characterization of current events. The end result is a general equilibrium model that endogenizes the supply of liquid assets and their rate of return. Using quarterly U.S. data from 1950 to 2008, we show that central predictions of the model find strong support in the data."
MBS Ratings and the Mortgage Credit Boom,RISK,2009,"This paper studies credit ratings on subprime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities (MBS) deals issued between 2001 and 2007, the period leading up to the subprime crisis. We first estimate a simple summary statistic for credit risk in each deal using a loan-level econometric model based on ex-ante data. Ratings conditional on this measure of credit risk and other controls exhibit significant time-series variation, becoming more conservative initially, then less conservative between 2005 to 2007, the peak of the mortgage credit boom. Our measure of default risk is significantly correlated with ex-post deal performance, even conditional on ratings. It is also a stronger predictor of ex-post performance than credit ratings in a simple “horse race”. Our evidence suggests that MBS ratings, while informative, were insufficiently sensitive to observable measures of risk, and did not respond to rising risk in the last part of the sample. We remain agnostic on whether shortcomings in ratings reflect innocent errors or incentive problems associated with the “issuer pays” credit rating model."

On the Real Effects of Bank Bailouts: Micro Evidence from Japan,RISK,2009,"Exploiting the Japanese banking crisis as a laboratory, we provide novel firm-level evidence on the real effects of different government interventions for resolving a systemic banking crisis. Our results show that government recapitalizations of weak banks result in significantly positive abnormal returns for those banks' clients. After recapitalizations, banks extend larger loans to their existing borrowers and some firms related to recapitalized banks increase investment, but do not create more jobs than comparable firms. Most importantly, recapitalizations allow banks to extend larger loans to low and high quality firms alike, and low quality firms experience higher abnormal returns than other firms upon the announcement of their lending banks' recapitalizations. Interestingly, recapitalizations by private investors have effects similar to government recapitalizations. Finally, we show that bank mergers engineered to enhance bank stability may hurt the borrowers of the sounder banks involved in the mergers."
Precautionary Hoarding of Liquidity and Inter-Bank Markets: Evidence from the Sub-prime Crisis,RISK,2009,"Using data on the behavior of large settlement banks in the UK and the Sterling Money Markets before and during the sub-prime crisis of 2007-08, we provide evidence of precautionary hoarding of liquidity and its effect on inter-bank borrowing rates. Our evidence consists of three pieces. First, we document that liquidity holdings of the large settlement banks in the UK experienced on average a 30% increase in the period immediately following 9th August, 2007, the widely accepted date of money-market “freeze” during the sub-prime crisis. Second, we show that following this structural break, bank liquidity had a precautionary nature in that it rose on calendar days predicted to have a large amount of fluctuations in payment and settlements activity and more so for banks that made larger losses during the crisis. Third, using the payment and settlements activity as an instrument, we establish a causal effect of bank liquidity on overnight inter-bank rates, in both secured and unsecured markets, an effect that is virtually absent in the period before the crisis. Importantly, precautionary hoardings by some settlement banks raised lending rates for all settlement banks, suggestive of a contagion-style systemic risk operating through inter-bank rates. Finally, variability in overnight inter-bank rates appears to have affected rates and volumes in household as well as corporate lending."
Securitization and Distressed Loan Renegotiation: Evidence from the Subprime Mortgage Crisis,RISK,2009,
Unstable Banking,RISK,2009,"We propose a theory of financial intermediaries operating in markets influenced by investor sentiment. In our model, banks make loans, securitize, distribute and trade them, or hold cash. They also borrow money, using their security holdings as collateral. We embed such banks in a stylized financial market, in which securitized loans may be mispriced, and investigate how banks allocate limited capital among the various activities, as well as how they choose their capital structure. Banks maximize profits, and there are no conflicts of interest between bank shareholders and creditors. The theory explains the cyclical behavior of credit and investment, but also accounts for the fundamental instability of banks operating in financial markets, especially when banks use leverage."
