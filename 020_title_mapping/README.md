[mapping.csv](mapping.csv) maps titles of the NBER Summer Institute presentations to the NBER Working Paper number and the Scopus EID of the published version. For published but not indexed manuscripts (such as proceedings of the Society for Economic Dynamics) we record the title only, but not the EID.

Necessary criteria to map presentation title and published version:
1. The authors of the working paper version are a subset of the authors of the published version.
2. The paper was published after it has been presented at NBER Summer Institutes.

Sufficient criteria:
* The NBER summer institute and/or the respective discussant are acknowledged in the published version.
* ideas.repec.org links both versions.
* SSRN links both versions.
* At least one author page links both versions.

Necessary and sufficient criteria to map presentations to NBER Working Papers:
* The title of the presentation matches.
* The title of the final publication matches.
